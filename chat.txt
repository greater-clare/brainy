[2020-11-14 09:38:04] Rob Maurin: The opposite end came off clean.  So I hope all I have to do is trim up the sawed end and pop it he end into place???
[2020-11-14 09:38:38] Grandpa Maurin: Repent !!!
[2020-11-14 09:39:17] Rob Maurin: It will rise from the dead
[2020-11-14 09:39:33] Rob Maurin: I guess I should wait three days first...
[2020-11-14 09:40:03] Omi Maurin: You guys!!!  No respect!
[2020-11-14 09:43:48] Grandpa Maurin: Please do wait three days and the other end will rise and attach itself to the bigger part.

[2020-11-15 05:58:52] Omi Maurin: Good morning!!!
Can you pls give me the particulars of the "change at home tire service".  I mentioned it to my friend at the pool and she is interested.  Her daughter has a flat tire in her downtown apartment.
THank  you!
[2020-11-15 06:13:55] Rob Maurin: The company is weel , and the website is getweel.com
[2020-11-15 06:15:10] Rob Maurin: We don’t know yet if it will really work I’m the space, but at least the shortening part is complete.
[2020-11-15 06:15:49] Grandpa Maurin: It looks great!
[2020-11-15 06:17:28] Omi Maurin: Thanks!
The bench looks great!!  Good work.  Will you be able to fit it in your car?
[2020-11-15 07:16:53] Rob Maurin: No way it will fit.  We’re going to need to rent a truck.  We tried for this weekend but nothing available!
[2020-11-15 08:44:07] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi all. Weel was great. Recommending them.
[2020-11-15 08:45:24] Omi Maurin: Thanks!  I passed Rob's info on to Malti.  Thanks
[2020-11-15 14:09:02] Omi Maurin: How are you all doing?  R&T arrived ok at the bunkie!
Heard about power outages in the east.  Wind is very strong here.
[2020-11-15 15:34:24] Mom Monica Maurin: We are fine at joes and Wiley
[2020-11-15 15:35:12] Omi Maurin: Good 
Have a nice evening.
[2020-11-15 18:06:38] Rob Maurin: We heard about a pepper spray incident at the Home Depot at Gerard Square.  Safe to assume Joe wasn’t working?
[2020-11-15 18:24:20] Mom Monica Maurin: Awful! Thanks. No joe wasn’t there.
[2020-11-15 18:29:20] Mom Monica Maurin: We can’t find any news about that at all. Hope everyone is ok

[2020-11-15 21:05:19] Omi Maurin: Have a great day!!!!  Lots of love, virtual hugs and kisses.
[2020-11-16 05:06:24] Kai Maurin-Jones: Woah! How'd you get it to say my name!! Very cool! Thanks Omi 😊
[2020-11-16 06:30:41] Rob Maurin: Wishing you a very happy birthday Kai.  Sorry we can’t be there to celebrate.
[2020-11-16 07:32:06] Omi Maurin: Thinking of your exciting day tomorrow, Teri and Rob.   Will the crane be installed today?  Do you have an estimate of the time the truck with the cottage will arrive?
[2020-11-16 07:35:10] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thank you !
[2020-11-16 07:35:45] Rob Maurin: Thanks mom.   

Crane comes tomorrow at 10.  
House comes tomorrow at 11.  

I’m trying to not stress about things out of my control, and at this point it’s all out of our control.  We’ll keep you posted.
[2020-11-16 11:32:48] Mom Monica Maurin: hohoho!
[2020-11-17 04:53:47] Grandpa Maurin: R&T have a successful day!!!
[2020-11-17 04:58:07] Mom Monica Maurin: yeah Rob and Teri -- thinking about you guys -- how are things shaping up?
[2020-11-17 05:00:31] Omi Maurin: Yayyyyy. The day has finally arrived!!!!
[2020-11-17 05:23:27] Rob Maurin: Thanks everyone.  

The builder’s installation crews were told by the builder to be here at 8:00. We were told by the builder the house isn’t arriving until noon.  So we’re off to a great start.  

But other than hurry up and wait, there’s nothing we can do.  

So we’re puttering.
[2020-11-17 05:24:18] Rob Maurin: The crane isn’t arriving until 11:00 (because the house isn’t supposed to be here until noon) so literally nothing can happen until then.
[2020-11-17 05:26:18] Omi Maurin: It’s going to feel like a looong morning...
Go back to sleep 😴
[2020-11-17 05:33:06] Mom Monica Maurin: But weather looks good? Driveway is passable?
[2020-11-17 05:34:30] Mom Monica Maurin: If the crane doesn’t arrive as early as you wish:

[2020-11-17 06:41:53] Grandpa Maurin: Great idea !
[2020-11-17 06:45:32] Grandpa Maurin: R&T you can play hopscotch to keep warm until you unload the house 🏠!
[2020-11-17 06:49:00] Teri Smith: Who needs hopscotch when we’ve got coffee and Bailey’s? 😄
[2020-11-17 06:50:03] Grandpa Maurin: Hmmm good, enjoy it!
[2020-11-17 06:50:35] Rob Maurin: (Coffee optional)
[2020-11-17 06:50:50] Rob Maurin: Very helpful! Thanks :-)
[2020-11-17 06:51:37] Rob Maurin: Sunny.  The occasional snowflake.  No meaningful accumulation.  And winds are (so far) low.  So we should be in business.
[2020-11-17 06:51:43] Rob Maurin: Thanks everyone!
[2020-11-17 06:55:46] Grandpa Maurin: Same weather here
[2020-11-17 06:58:48] Mom Monica Maurin: That’s great weather!! Yay for you!

[2020-11-17 08:58:29] Rob Maurin: And people from down the road can’t get by...
[2020-11-17 08:58:31] Rob Maurin: Oops
[2020-11-17 08:59:01] Omi Maurin: They have an interesting show!  Wish we were there!!!
[2020-11-17 09:10:29] Grandpa Maurin: Fabulous, exciting, wonderful!!!
[2020-11-17 09:29:09] Omi Maurin: Did they make it down the driveway with the cottage?
[2020-11-17 09:29:49] Rob Maurin: Not yet.  It’s still blocking the road
[2020-11-17 09:30:17] Omi Maurin: Ouch

[2020-11-17 12:23:09] Omi Maurin: Are you sitting on the platform you made to watch?
[2020-11-17 13:23:06] Grandpa Maurin: Hip, hip, hooray 😃!!!!!!!!!!’
[2020-11-17 13:44:16] Rob Maurin: (Out of sequence of course)
[2020-11-17 13:44:40] Rob Maurin: The guys are still working.  More done tuning to do. But the scary part is done.
[2020-11-17 13:44:54] Rob Maurin: *fine tuning

[2020-11-17 17:22:30] Rob Maurin: All done for the night. Except for a truck that's stuck on the driveway, for which we're being charged by the hour... ouch. Not a good finish. But the house itself is done for the day. The rest of the installation and finishing (the roof, the siding) will happen tomorrow.
[2020-11-17 17:24:43] Omi Maurin: Looks amazing!!! Congratulations!!!
Sleep and relax to be able to enjoy your new cottage!!!!
Good night 😘
[2020-11-17 17:32:04] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for the video, unbelievable!. Perhaps the crane could help the truck out of its misery . Have a good and restful sleep 💤 .
[2020-11-17 18:45:50] Mom Monica Maurin: that's an experience of a lifetime! amazing!
[2020-11-18 04:17:30] Omi Maurin: WOWWWW!

[2020-11-18 04:18:11] Omi Maurin: Are the truck, crane and workers gone?
[2020-11-18 04:26:21] Mom Monica Maurin: What a view! How does it feel? So happy for you guys!
[2020-11-18 04:26:25] Mom Monica Maurin: more pics pease
[2020-11-18 05:13:15] Grandpa Maurin: Good morning all !!!! I want coffee, please , with a view of the lake !!!!!!
[2020-11-18 05:36:59] Rob Maurin: Yes, after a several hours last night a jumbo tow truck came and removed the trucks that were stuck.  Crews were gone around 10:30. 
The install crews are back again now.  Apparently it will take a couple of days for the installation to be complete.  That’s fine with me.  This is all part of what we paid for so do it right.
[2020-11-18 05:39:26] Grandpa Maurin: Great news and the sun is shining!
[2020-11-18 05:40:05] Omi Maurin: It looks so  HUGE!!!!  Sooo happy for you (and for all of us)!!
[2020-11-18 05:46:33] Mom Monica Maurin: love all the rocks in the foreground -- classic canadian landscape

[2020-11-18 06:55:26] Rob Maurin: Thanks everyone.  We can’t wait for you to visit.
[2020-11-18 06:56:49] Omi Maurin: Neither can we!!!   Did your Poverty Bay friends watch  yesterday?  It must have been so amazing, scary, nerving, etc.  Can't wait to hear all your details!
Have a more relaxing day, but keep sending pictures!!
[2020-11-18 07:27:44] Rob Maurin: Yes, we had about a dozen people here, freezing their butts, watching the show.
[2020-11-18 08:11:21] Mom Monica Maurin: It's an amazing thing -- all of the windows, the whole structure looks great though it travelled by truck,  had changes in temperature and then flew....amazing creation.
[2020-11-18 15:07:46] Omi Maurin: I'm having picture withdrawal symptoms!!!  Nothing to report from Poverty Bay??
[2020-11-18 17:06:08] Mom Monica Maurin: Same same
[2020-11-19 05:33:03] Omi Maurin: Good morning!!!  How is everyone doing?
[2020-11-19 05:39:23] Grandpa Maurin: I’m doing fine, getting ready to go to the vampire lady to suck my blood!
[2020-11-19 06:01:42] Mom Monica Maurin: What vampire?
[2020-11-19 06:45:08] Omi Maurin: Regular blood work for both of us.  Results next week, but probably everything ok.
[2020-11-19 06:53:37] Rob Maurin: Just routine?
[2020-11-19 06:57:05] Rob Maurin: We’re good. Tired.  Had an old friend from high school (John Till) stop by.  Hadn’t seen him in 20+ years.  We thought he was coming for a couple of hours.  He stayed the night...

So that was unexpected and tiring, but we’re on our own again now.  

Work continues on the house.  Not a ton yesterday, and little things like putting up doors.  We’ll send more photos when there’s something new to see!
[2020-11-19 07:19:23] Omi Maurin: Just routine.  Every 3 months.
[2020-11-19 07:20:23] Omi Maurin: Nice to see friends from high school after 20 years.  I don't remember that name.
Let's hope you can relax and recover today.  Looking forward to more pictures.
[2020-11-19 07:38:08] Mom Monica Maurin: Johnny Style
[2020-11-19 07:38:24] Rob Maurin: That’s the one.
[2020-11-19 09:27:22] Mom Monica Maurin: :)
[2020-11-19 09:27:30] Mom Monica Maurin: funny that i can remember his nickname
[2020-11-19 11:15:06] Omi Maurin: We are getting a new vegetarian restaurant at the north-east corner of Hurontario and Eglinton

https://freshplantpowered.com/menus/toronto/
[2020-11-19 11:16:23] Omi Maurin: Let's hope this one can survive Covid.  For the looongest time they had a sign "Italian Street Food",  bu it never got off the ground.  Poor people.
Across the street, where we had a Swiss Chalet,  it looks like we are getting a Healthy PLanet store.
[2020-11-19 12:16:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Yummmmmy!!!! I like these guys. Very yummy!
[2020-11-20 06:03:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Healthy Planet has very good prices on supplements etc. Way better than the Big Carrot
[2020-11-20 06:38:04] Rob Maurin: I just noticed my Facebook privacy settings were weird. If you were blocked from my recent cottage posts, it was unintentional!!
[2020-11-20 06:38:54] Rob Maurin: And good morning to you all.
[2020-11-20 06:40:00] Omi Maurin: Good morning!!  How are things at Poverty Bay?  What all was accomplished yesterday?  Saw that you were already toasting in your new home.  Congrats!!!!
[2020-11-20 06:48:27] Rob Maurin: No, not finished.  Still a couple of days’ work left to finish the exterior.  The people who told us it was a one-day install were full of poo. 

The photo Sue posted was from Wednesday, the first opportunity the neighbours had to look inside.  We were hoping to watch the sun set, but it was so overcast you couldn’t see it at all.  It just got dark.  

But last night Teri and I were there to see the sun go down behind the hill.  It doesn’t set for us across the water like it does for Kay and Sue in summer.  But it was still pretty.
[2020-11-20 07:05:36] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for your report, Rob, Sue’s photo gives us an idea of the interior of the cottage, 🥂 cheers 🍻, enjoy it.
[2020-11-20 07:53:21] Mom Monica Maurin: Glad it's moving along. Happy for you!
[2020-11-20 10:17:44] Rob Maurin: The light coloured cross-braces will be removed
[2020-11-20 10:17:56] Rob Maurin: You can see the bunkie in the trees on the left
[2020-11-20 10:18:40] Rob Maurin: The yellow stuff next to the house is a covered pile of construction material
[2020-11-20 10:34:48] Mom Monica Maurin: That’s so neat.
[2020-11-20 10:48:02] Omi Maurin: Nice!!!  Even from the opposite shore it looks HUGE!!!
[2020-11-20 12:44:29] Omi Maurin: Nov 23. Toronto and Peel move into lockdown.
[2020-11-20 13:07:10] Mom Monica Maurin: What does that mean?
[2020-11-20 13:11:54] Rob Maurin: Does anyone want to schedule a FaceTime call tomorrow mid-day, and I can give you a walk-through if the new place?
[2020-11-20 13:12:26] Omi Maurin: Yes!!

[2020-11-22 07:19:06] Mom Monica Maurin: Wow! We walked right past it and didn’t notice it. Thanks for sharing
[2020-11-22 07:24:24] Teri Smith: We picked something up there a few months ago. We took dessert to some friends, and we didn’t get to try what we bought! But everything looked delicious, and it’s a very cute little shop.
[2020-11-22 07:32:47] Mom Monica Maurin: :)

HOW DO COURT RECORDERS KEEP STRAIGHT FACES????
These are from a book called Disorder in the American Courts and are things people actually said in court, word for word, taken down and published by court reporters that had the torment of staying calm while the exchanges were taking place.

ATTORNEY: And in what ways does it affect your memory?
WITNESS: I forget..
ATTORNEY: You forget? Can you give us an example of something you forgot?
___________________________________________
ATTORNEY: Now doctor, isn't it true that when a person dies in his sleep, he doesn't know about it until the next morning?
WITNESS: Did you actually pass the bar exam?
____________________________________

ATTORNEY: The youngest son, the 20-year-old, how old is he?

ATTORNEY: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?
WITNESS: No.
ATTORNEY: Did you check for blood pressure?
WITNESS: No.
ATTORNEY: Did you check for breathing?
WITNESS: No..
ATTORNEY: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?

We were supposed to be there yesterday for an inspection, but that got delayed by about a week. Which was great because Teri and I are still catching up from being away from work last week. 
We'll send pics of anything worth pic-ing.

[2020-11-29 11:28:59] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey all. I just had a chat with mom and dad and they said they're not getting xmas presents for anyone. Is that across the board then? We can make plans for a zoom xmas or whatever in person if we want, but what are we doing about gifts? Just checking if we have any kind of consensus so I know. The idea behind the no gifts is to free anyone from going into stores....
[2020-11-29 11:31:30] Rob Maurin: I’m good with that.
[2020-11-29 11:31:56] Mom Monica Maurin: okey dokey. me too.
[2020-11-29 11:32:47] Mom Monica Maurin: And we can figure out how to celebrate closer to the time but I say we reserve the 24th for whatever it is we decide to do -- zoom or sit outside or inside or what what.....tbd
[2020-11-29 11:38:09] Mom Monica Maurin: Pics from our lake today:

[2020-11-30 16:54:48] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok thank you. No news is good news. We don’t generally get much snail mail so that’s fine. Thanks for being the lookout!
[2020-12-01 09:25:48] Mom Monica Maurin: You too!!

[2020-12-02 07:02:48] Rob Maurin: Someone in Toronto won $60 mil with Lotto Max. Was it one of you? (It wasn't us.)
[2020-12-02 07:06:10] Grandpa Maurin: No, not us.
[2020-12-02 07:24:08] Omi Maurin: I was sure we were going to win it, but no.... 😢😢😢
[2020-12-02 07:52:42] Omi Maurin: Howdy!
George just called to offer 2 garden chairs, foldable, cloth,  that they had in the house and he has kept in the locker all these years.  He was wondering if one of you might be interested.  They are very nice, which is why he has kept them, but they take up too much room in the locker and that's why he wants to get rid of them.
Any takers??
Let us know.
[2020-12-02 08:11:03] Aidan Maurin-Jones: @14169067363 maybe for the office?
[2020-12-02 08:15:31] Omi Maurin: I like the Synthetic version better!!!
[2020-12-02 09:51:40] Mom Monica Maurin: hahaha!!!
[2020-12-02 09:52:19] Mom Monica Maurin: I like the synthetics better too. Nice memories.
[2020-12-02 13:33:40] Rob Maurin: Aw, thanks everyone.
[2020-12-02 15:51:03] Omi Maurin: Iris’ Xmas tree 🤣
[2020-12-02 15:59:49] Mom Monica Maurin: No way!!
[2020-12-02 16:00:01] Mom Monica Maurin: Good for her :)
[2020-12-03 07:56:39] Mom Monica Maurin: hehe. that's a funny one. perhaps everyone likes Perrier? then again, some don't like the bubbles....
[2020-12-03 07:56:45] Mom Monica Maurin: have a good day everyone
[2020-12-03 08:07:36] Grandpa Maurin: You too! You are the only one who has reacted to the joke. (My jokes are so funny 😂 but are not appreciated).
[2020-12-03 08:48:17] Mom Monica Maurin: I APPRECIATE THEM!!
[2020-12-03 08:52:23] Joe Lagan: Sorry, I’ve been on the floor holding my sides and not able to breathe from laughing. Only now just able to type.
[2020-12-03 08:52:39] Joe Lagan: Funny :)
[2020-12-03 08:56:15] Grandpa Maurin: Poor Joe, my next joke will be less hilarious!
[2020-12-03 08:56:42] Joe Lagan: Whew!
[2020-12-03 08:56:45] Mom Monica Maurin: now you've got joe laughing again!
[2020-12-03 08:56:57] Rob Maurin: For real, she did this?
[2020-12-03 08:58:13] Rob Maurin: 🙂
[2020-12-03 08:59:38] Grandpa Maurin: Yes, Iris sent it as their own tree. I will use it to go with my Xmas greetings.
[2020-12-03 09:42:36] Omi Maurin: At the hospital with Dot
She went in to get the marks for her radiation. 
The doctor had a few words with me and asked about her sons. I only said one lives inAjax the other one in Scarborough. He does know the story...
I only said “they aren’t model sons”. He said “they don’t exist anymore“. 
I said yes they do. Mine is!! And so is my daughter!! 🥰🤗
[2020-12-03 09:45:45] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for your report Vally.
[2020-12-03 09:50:36] Grandpa Maurin: Regarding the joke: yes, I do want to be vaccinated. It will be the only way to be relatively safe. If you decline the vaccine, only your good luck will keep you safe!
[2020-12-03 10:55:04] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you. My sons are awesome too. Sorry to hear about Dot
[2020-12-03 10:58:20] Rob Maurin: xo

[2020-12-03 11:08:41] Mom Monica Maurin: Holy smokes. Sending her lots of love!!
[2020-12-03 11:09:34] Rob Maurin: Ask her: Now that she has a tattoo, is she getting a motorcycle?
‎[2020-12-03 11:10:18] Omi Maurin: ‎sticker omis
[2020-12-03 12:24:45] Grandpa Maurin: Great , happy for Teri and you. Are you going there tonight?
[2020-12-03 12:30:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Looks awesome on both counts!
[2020-12-03 12:47:10] Rob Maurin: No, we will head up Saturday morning in a rented van full of furniture and stuff.
[2020-12-03 12:51:50] Grandpa Maurin: Okay . You can expect partly cloudy/ sunny weather. Are you taking the choir pew?.
[2020-12-03 12:54:38] Rob Maurin: Yes! And the chairs we got from Monica, and a bed we got from a friend, and boxes of kitchen things we got from Ken and from Ryan’s mom, and other odds and ends...!! It’s the hand-me-down delivery.
[2020-12-03 12:57:08] Grandpa Maurin: Great, exciting.
[2020-12-03 13:03:59] Omi Maurin: Amazing!  So happy for you!!
[2020-12-03 13:05:21] Omi Maurin: Dot just went in for her radiation ☢️ 
Appointment with the doctor thereafter and then home, hopefully 🙏

[2020-12-03 13:52:52] Rob Maurin: Nice!
[2020-12-03 15:21:13] Mom Monica Maurin: Beautiful. So happy for Tio Eduardo.
[2020-12-03 15:21:26] Mom Monica Maurin: I hope it all went well.
[2020-12-03 16:09:59] Omi Maurin: Yes, it went well. Radiation didn’t hurt at all. 
She was very relieved. And so was I!!
Long, emotional exhausting day.
[2020-12-03 16:32:25] Omi Maurin: Sounds exciting!!!!
[2020-12-04 06:57:14] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
[2020-12-04 07:06:16] Grandpa Maurin: Cute !
[2020-12-04 07:07:57] Grandpa Maurin: Good morning to you too, what is the weather like in your neighbourhood, Marty?
[2020-12-04 07:10:49] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Morning!!
[2020-12-04 07:16:52] Mom Monica Maurin: you guys are funny.

[2020-12-04 07:18:00] Mom Monica Maurin: a good day to order some veggies and make a nice soup. maybe find a book online -- did you know that the Toronto Public Library has thousands of magazines and newspapers from all over the world available online for free??
[2020-12-04 07:18:23] Mom Monica Maurin: maybe check out the mississauga library. i'm sure you can get a membership online these days.
[2020-12-04 07:20:46] Mom Monica Maurin: that's horrible! and joe is DYING LAUGHING!

[2020-12-04 08:45:29] Rob Maurin: 🙂
[2020-12-04 08:46:00] Rob Maurin: I started with this today:
[2020-12-04 08:46:01] Rob Maurin: https://www.facebook.com/traductormental/posts/401287784564770
[2020-12-04 08:46:20] Rob Maurin: which led me down a path to try to understand "cuico," which led me to this
[2020-12-04 08:46:25] Rob Maurin: https://laurenonlocation.com/10-most-common-chilean-slang-words/
[2020-12-04 08:46:30] Rob Maurin: which is a fun read
[2020-12-04 08:47:35] Rob Maurin: Though I now understand the use of cuico, I don't get the actual meaning or etymology of it. Online Spanish dictionaries translate it as "earthworm" which doesn't connect with the Chilean meaning as far as I can see. Dad/Mom, any thoughts on the origin of the Chilean usage?
[2020-12-04 09:17:20] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, I will write to you later on this subject.
[2020-12-05 04:36:03] Omi Maurin: https://youtu.be/zDXyX2-0a64
[2020-12-05 07:52:02] Kai Maurin-Jones: 😂😂

[2020-12-05 13:33:25] Omi Maurin: 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼👍🏼
[2020-12-05 13:34:04] Omi Maurin: What else has been done?
[2020-12-05 13:36:03] Teri Smith: Sadly, not much.
[2020-12-05 13:41:51] Omi Maurin: 😢😢  Enjoy what you have so far!!!  Will you sleep in the house or in the bunkie?
Did you unload the van already?
[2020-12-05 13:46:26] Teri Smith: We’ll sleep in the bunkie. No furniture in the cottage yet. We’ll unload the van tomorrow. The stuff will either go into the shipping container or to Robb and Shari’s for now.
[2020-12-05 13:47:18] Omi Maurin: 👍🏼
[2020-12-05 15:04:59] Mom Monica Maurin: Looks nice!

[2020-12-06 07:20:38] Rob Maurin: Good morning!
[2020-12-06 07:20:52] Rob Maurin: I asked Siri to tell me a joke.  Enjoy!
[2020-12-06 07:22:13] Omi Maurin: 🤣🤣🤣
[2020-12-06 07:25:20] Grandpa Maurin: Siri is so smart !
[2020-12-06 07:35:00] Mom Monica Maurin: 👏
[2020-12-06 07:47:12] Omi Maurin: Is the lake frozen, Rob and Teri?
[2020-12-06 07:49:06] Grandpa Maurin: Ask Siri and do not bother the movers!
[2020-12-06 09:30:54] Omi Maurin: A bit long; for when you have time.
[2020-12-06 12:12:50] Rob Maurin: There is ice from end to end, but I wouldn’t trust it to hold more than a rabbit.

[2020-12-07 14:49:14] Mom Monica Maurin: It's been a day and a half already
[2020-12-07 14:49:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Q: Why did the fish blush?
[2020-12-07 15:22:04] Grandpa Maurin: Because it was a pink salmon.
[2020-12-07 16:40:30] Mom Monica Maurin: Because it saw the ocean’s bottom.
[2020-12-07 17:51:46] Omi Maurin: 🤣🤣
[2020-12-08 04:55:32] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning everyone.
[2020-12-08 04:56:10] Mom Monica Maurin: I sent you such a great joke yesterday. I hope you are still enjoying it. (That’s my ode to dad today.)
[2020-12-08 04:56:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Xoxox
[2020-12-08 04:56:40] Mom Monica Maurin: It’s a really pretty sunrise here. And it’s going to be mild out today. December has been pretty gentle so far. Yay!
[2020-12-08 05:04:23] Grandpa Maurin: Good morning to you too. I laughed so hard last night that I had insomnia. It is a nice sunrise 🌅 here in Mississauga, it is a crisp -6 degrees. I love ❤️ it. Everyone have a great day!
[2020-12-08 05:08:18] Mom Monica Maurin: Glad you’re enjoying the joke and the weather!
[2020-12-08 05:14:23] Grandpa Maurin: It is a horrible 18 degrees in SCL going up to 31 !

[2020-12-10 08:00:42] Rob Maurin: Random memory: @19056091946 Am I right in remembering that Alberto (and Diane) would make popcorn and then keep it in the freezer and eat it frozen?
[2020-12-10 08:05:14] Mom Monica Maurin: Whaaaat? I don't know of this.
[2020-12-10 08:05:37] Mom Monica Maurin: And.....drum rolll.........39 days until we get our new  place! We are in the 30s now for the countdown! Yayyy!
[2020-12-10 08:06:24] Omi Maurin: I don't remember the popcorn.  Funny you should have this memory today that it is Alberto's birthday.
[2020-12-10 08:07:27] Omi Maurin: Yayyyy!  The date of taking possession of your new place gets closer and clores!!!
[2020-12-10 08:08:07] Mom Monica Maurin: Wow ---- that's an interesting thing. Today's his birthday. Wow.
[2020-12-10 08:10:45] Grandpa Maurin: I do not remember anything about Alberto’s popcorn 🍿
[2020-12-10 08:14:20] Grandpa Maurin: Maybe they had it for break -first !!!
[2020-12-10 08:21:05] Grandpa Maurin: December will go quickly and then it will be time to arrange the details of the move. Looking forward to moving boxes to the third floor which is my specialty!!!
[2020-12-10 08:40:41] Rob Maurin: Wow. That is a super weird coincidence!
[2020-12-10 08:41:12] Rob Maurin: Congratulations! I was thinking about your new place just the other day and how fun it'll be to live there.
[2020-12-10 09:13:31] Mom Monica Maurin: It's going to be really fun. we have some great ideas for the house and we've also been walking to the lake and through the neighbourhood and it's pinch-me gorgeous!
[2020-12-10 09:13:41] Mom Monica Maurin: Amazing good luck getting that house
[2020-12-10 09:13:50] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks for the good wishes.
[2020-12-10 18:19:36] Grandpa Maurin: First results of the vaccination in Britain

Have a nice day!!
[2020-12-12 11:47:18] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi mom. Doing okay here. It's been a day of making calls to moving companies, cleaning up the apartment....basic to-dos....and now going to work a bit. Weather is fine here -- just a bit of rain. How about for you?
[2020-12-12 11:55:46] Omi Maurin: We are ok; nothing new.  Have a good afternoon

[2020-12-14 07:15:45] Omi Maurin: In Cocholgue, close to Concepción, visiting Onkel Alfred Dannenberg (Ulele's uncle).  Your first ride in a oxen driven "carriage".  The "driver" couldn't believe you had never been on such a mode of trnsportation, but you had flown from Canada to Chile.
[2020-12-14 08:21:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Love that little story. We are lucky kids! How old were you, mom? 27?
[2020-12-14 08:21:43] Mom Monica Maurin: You were about as old as I was when I had Aidan.

Yesterday was Nelba's birthday and Francisco went to visit her.  We don't  know more details.
[2020-12-17 15:10:57] Omi Maurin: Francisco looks good
[2020-12-17 15:11:22] Rob Maurin: He looks very different but I like it
[2020-12-17 15:11:35] Omi Maurin: Me too
[2020-12-17 15:12:25] Rob Maurin: Did Nelba send you the photo?

[2020-12-17 17:45:28] Mom Monica Maurin: I totally knew who it was -- and they look fabulous! all grown up!
[2020-12-18 05:33:15] Omi Maurin: T'was a week before Christmas,
And all through the town,
People wore masks,
That covered their frown.
The frown had begun
Way back in the Spring,
When a global pandemic
Changed everything.
They called it corona,
But unlike the beer,
It didn’t bring good times,
It didn’t bring cheer.
Airplanes were grounded,
Travel was banned.
Borders were closed
Across air, sea and land.
As the world entered lockdown
To flatten the curve,
The economy halted,
And folks lost their nerve.
From March to July
We rode the first wave,
People stayed home,
They tried to behave.
When summer emerged
The lockdown was lifted.
But away from caution,
Many folks drifted.
Now it’s December
And cases are spiking,
Wave two has arrived,
Much to our disliking.
It’s true that this year
Has had sadness a plenty,
We’ll never forget
The year 2020.
And just ‘round the corner -
The holiday season,
But why be merry?
Is there even one reason?
To decorate the house
And put up the tree,
Who will see it,
No one but me.
But outside my window
The snow gently falls,
And I think to myself,
Let’s deck the halls!
So, I gather the ribbon,
The garland and bows,
As I play those old carols,
My happiness grows.
Christmas is not cancelled
And neither is hope.
If we lean on each other,
I know we can cope. 

Merry Christmas to all

[2020-12-18 12:46:48] Mom Monica Maurin: not surprising, i guess. i think we are in the thick of it for a while. i wonder if they close the schools down if it would improve. hopefully we can all ride it out nice and healthy and in the spring it will improve.
[2020-12-18 12:46:58] Mom Monica Maurin: let's chat some more about xmas and fine tune our plans
‎[2020-12-19 05:49:26] Omi Maurin: ‎sticker omis
[2020-12-19 06:35:11] Rob Maurin: The brain is such a weird thing.  

A name popped into my head this morning:
Amin Datoo

If I’m correct, this was the sales guy dad would deal with at Rumble Pontiac Buick, on Bayview, when we lived in Leaside.  (🎶 Ramble into Rumble, you’ll see 🎶)

Dad, did I get that right?
[2020-12-19 06:43:29] Grandpa Maurin: Perfect, Rob!!!! If you had asked me what was the name of the salesman at Rumble, I would have never remembered it. However, when I read the name I recognized it and the whole picture came back. WOW!!!!
[2020-12-19 06:48:09] Grandpa Maurin: Wasn’t the Buick Centurion a beauty?. It had a 454 cubic inch engine.
[2020-12-19 06:49:36] Grandpa Maurin: It was a dream that came true.
[2020-12-19 07:02:29] Rob Maurin: I wonder what it would sell for if you could find one today.  
1972?
[2020-12-19 07:04:03] Rob Maurin: https://classiccars.com/listings/find/1972-1974/buick/centurion
[2020-12-19 07:04:03] Rob Maurin: There’s a red 1973 for $14k
[2020-12-19 07:08:14] Rob Maurin: And this listing gives some history of the Centurion that I didn’t know:
 https://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/dealer/buick/centurion/2450508.html
[2020-12-19 07:19:44] Omi Maurin: Are you at the bunkie R&T or still in TO?
[2020-12-19 07:24:56] Grandpa Maurin: WOW, Rob, unbelievable, congratulations on your finds!
[2020-12-19 07:31:45] Rob Maurin: At the bunkie. 
Not nearly the progress we were hoping for. 
The floor is in the bathroom but nowhere else.  
Some wiring was done in the basement.  
Some framing was begun for the solar panels but nothing erected.  
So it’s still a construction site and totally unusable.  I’m having doubts they’ll make it habitable before the new year.
[2020-12-19 07:33:25] Omi Maurin: Too bad!!  Enjoy the weekend anyway!!  

😘🤗
[2020-12-19 07:33:27] Mom Monica Maurin: I'm bummed for you that the progress isn't progress-y. Sucks. I wonder if it's year-end and covid-blues that's just messing everyone up.
[2020-12-19 07:33:46] Mom Monica Maurin: the car story.....i remember that name as well. and the car. :)
[2020-12-19 07:34:48] Joe Lagan: Totally freaked... I was driving that exact car. Same color same everything in a dream a couple of nights ago. So weird!
[2020-12-19 07:35:13] Rob Maurin: I think it’s just the universal problem of trades not doing what they promise.  COVID is a good scapegoat, but not the cause in any legitimate way as far as I can see. 
Ah well.
[2020-12-19 07:35:25] Rob Maurin: No kidding!
[2020-12-19 07:36:06] Joe Lagan: Yes. Can’t remember
Anything else about the dream but I totally remember the car.
[2020-12-19 07:38:57] Rob Maurin: Ours was red, with the red vinyl roof.
[2020-12-19 07:40:54] Rob Maurin: ‎Ce message a été supprimé.

[2020-12-19 07:42:11] Rob Maurin: I shouldn’t be totally grumpy. The drywall looks to be complete (muddling, taping, sanding) with at least one coat of primer in most places.  So that’s nice.  
And something related to the hearing system was installed (boiler? I don’t know), though it’s just one part of the installation.

[2020-12-19 12:51:57] Rob Maurin: Monica, Tracie said to send you this:

“Rob, show Monica! I traded up my pen from the Christmas cracker of 2019. I got a mug, baseball hat, window scraper and breast cancer xmas ornament. What did she get?”

[2020-12-19 12:54:24] Teri Smith: In case you don’t remember, Tracie and Monica both got pens in their Christmas crackers and said they would have a competition for who could trade up to the best thing by this Christmas. I’m surprised tracie remembered!
[2020-12-19 14:59:55] Mom Monica Maurin: I had not forgotten. But I never could find that pen :)
[2020-12-19 15:00:06] Mom Monica Maurin: Can’t wait to see what she got!

[2020-12-20 12:44:43] Mom Monica Maurin: We had a great visit at the new house. Looking wonderful! So excited to move in soon. 
And we went to our coffee shop and the lady already knew me and asked how our neighbourhood exploring is going. She told me she wouldn’t be there next Sunday and wished us a great holiday. :)
We are growing into our neighbourhood. So nice.
[2020-12-20 12:44:57] Mom Monica Maurin: This pic is at the ravine by our new place.
[2020-12-20 12:45:16] Mom Monica Maurin: Just as we were entering the park.

[2020-12-20 13:29:37] Grandpa Maurin: Yes, we are fortunate to have a caring family but this is the result of collective effort to want to keep it this way. Today has been a great day, as we say in Spanish it has been a “round day”.
[2020-12-20 13:38:46] Mom Monica Maurin: I agree. Very much so. It filled me up.

[2020-12-23 15:59:49] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi everyone! I meant to message you this morning and tell you that I didn't get empanadas. I think it unlikely that I will do so tomorrow. I just didn't want to leave you wondering so thought I'd message you about it.
[2020-12-23 16:15:50] Rob Maurin: No worries.  Thanks.
[2020-12-23 16:17:59] Grandpa Maurin: Please forget about the empanadas, we can feast on them later . Thanks anyways.

Let us know if we can zoom bomb any of your gatherings for one minute to say hi to those we won’t be seeing. I was thinking of saying hi to Teri’s family....so if you send us a link if you happen to have the right moment in time we can join up and say hi and the exit out again
Or else just please say hi for us if those logistics don’t work out.

But it’s enough to put a mattress on the floor and start to settle in!

[2020-12-27 08:13:26] Rob Maurin: :-)
[2020-12-27 08:13:37] Rob Maurin: Thanks for the anniversary wishes, everyone!
[2020-12-27 08:25:11] Omi Maurin: https://www.blogto.com/city/2020/12/toronto-streetcar-routes-construction-2021/?fbclid=IwAR2phdkdn7cnfP0jucvirmOvuG0RkIGO_Ki519o0kTom24cV8vGsE4UMqaE
[2020-12-27 08:25:50] Omi Maurin: They mention a couple of changes affecting the Main St. buses.  Would that affect you in the new house Mo, Aidan and Kai?
[2020-12-27 08:28:20] Aidan Maurin-Jones: No it shouldn’t as the subway is walking distance
[2020-12-27 08:48:43] Grandpa Maurin: Kai, Juniors World Cup, I remembered Don Cherry was against huge number of goals by a team like this one of 16-2. Once it becomes obvious that the team will win there is no point in scoring more goals because it is humiliating for the losing side. Happy that Canada 🇨🇦 won and wish they get the Cup.
[2020-12-27 08:50:53] Grandpa Maurin: Are Monica, Aidan, Kai and Joe going to visit the exterior of the new house today?
[2020-12-27 08:59:52] Mom Monica Maurin: We are visiting the house today. Meeting at noon and then going for a walk
[2020-12-27 09:01:00] Grandpa Maurin: Say hello! to the house 🏠 for me!
[2020-12-27 09:03:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you!!
[2020-12-27 11:33:22] Kai Maurin-Jones: My thoughts, too. 16 is overkill.
[2020-12-27 11:42:11] Mom Monica Maurin: It was a nice walk around the new neighbourhood — chilly but invigorating. :)
[2020-12-27 11:55:10] Joe Lagan: Happy anniversary Rob and Terry!
[2020-12-27 12:21:34] Omi Maurin: 👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼❤️

[2020-12-27 15:35:45] Mom Monica Maurin: Front and centre!
[2020-12-27 16:26:54] Rob Maurin: Thanks Joe!
[2020-12-27 16:29:57] Rob Maurin: It’s one of those things that’s caused by the rules.  
If I recall correctly:
If, at the end of the preliminary rounds, teams are tied (same number of wins, losses and ties), then the overall winner is determined by the margin by which they won their games.  Which is fair in a way, but it means you can’t have mercy on your opponent when you’re kicking their ass, because that margin may become significant at some point.  

So though it seems classless to keep abusing an inferior opponent, you have to...
[2020-12-27 16:39:13] Kai Maurin-Jones: Makes sense
[2020-12-27 21:10:03] Grandpa Maurin: Yes, you are right about that rule, Rob. The same rule is applied in soccer 🥅 and chances are that a similar rule exists in other sports 🥎.
[2020-12-28 08:06:05] Mom Monica Maurin: That's very interesting.

[2020-12-28 18:02:12] Rob Maurin: I’ve brushed the snow off.  Apparently, once the sun comes out, it tends to melt the snow from the panels.  We’ll see...

[2020-12-31 08:32:35] Omi Maurin: What?  No big get-together at the new cottage?
We will get together here with Megan and George for dinner and hopefully wait for the New Year, if we last that long...
[2020-12-31 08:33:46] Rob Maurin: Nope.  No get togethers.  We’re all being very responsible.
[2020-12-31 08:34:51] Omi Maurin: Good for you!!  We only get togethe with the Trasewichs, because they are also careful, as we are.
This afternoon I'm taking Dot for her 3rd radiation treatment.  That is all

[2021-01-13 08:29:07] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks!
[2021-01-13 09:03:53] Rob Maurin: What's the countdown at? 5 days?
[2021-01-13 09:04:16] Omi Maurin: Yayyy!
[2021-01-13 09:04:38] Omi Maurin: Did you manage your deadline yesterday??
[2021-01-13 09:06:17] Rob Maurin: Yes. There was a big company event and it went well. 
Today, of course, is the barrage of emails: what about this thing and that thing... and the next thing... So lots of work still. But we delivered what we had to on the deadline and people seem pleased.
[2021-01-13 09:07:03] Omi Maurin: Great!!!!!  Congrats!!!!
[2021-01-13 09:08:28] Rob Maurin: thanks
[2021-01-13 10:56:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Congrats!!
[2021-01-13 10:57:32] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes 5 days!
[2021-01-13 11:29:25] Grandpa Maurin: Glad that you finished your project and presented it on time, Rob.
[2021-01-14 04:29:23] Mom Monica Maurin: Here's a better description of the order:
[2021-01-14 04:29:24] Mom Monica Maurin: https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/terms-of-ontarios-stay-at-home-order-have-been-released-here-are-the-highlights
[2021-01-14 05:32:32] Omi Maurin: Thank you!!
There is not much change for Dad and I.  We've been doing that for a while...  The only thing we do, that is not on the list is getting together once a week with Megan and George.
We could adapt the following to "two individuals":

 If an individual lives alone, gathering with the members of a single household is permitted.
[2021-01-14 05:33:42] Omi Maurin: We had a circular in the building yesterday that a case of Covid 19 has been reported in the building 😟.   No indication of apartment number or floor.
[2021-01-14 05:40:40] Omi Maurin: Teri and Rob, are  you going to the cottage?
[2021-01-14 05:52:58] Omi Maurin: Will they be able to continue working at the cottage?
[2021-01-14 05:55:29] Mom Monica Maurin: Same here. Doesn’t change anything. Luckily all of our moving plans are ok under the act
[2021-01-14 05:55:50] Mom Monica Maurin: Going to the bank to get the draft and going to the lawyer today. Big day!
[2021-01-14 05:56:09] Mom Monica Maurin: Got the services lined up for hookup yesterday and confirmed the moving company. Yay!
[2021-01-14 06:03:56] Omi Maurin: Yayyyyy!!!!!

[2021-01-15 07:34:32] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning!
[2021-01-15 07:34:40] Mom Monica Maurin: 3 sleeps!!
[2021-01-15 07:44:05] Grandpa Maurin: Can’t wait anymore, take a long beauty sleep and recharge your batteries!
[2021-01-15 07:50:45] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes sir!
[2021-01-15 15:11:40] Rob Maurin: We haven't heard anything about whether they are or aren't working. I have to assume they are, though. For the little that's left, they could work in there one person at a time and be totally isolated.
[2021-01-15 15:13:29] Rob Maurin: We were on the fence, but the heat is an issue. The backup generator isn't automatic yet, so if there's not enough sun to power the batteries, then the heat won't go on and then the pipes will freeze. So that's our rationalization, anyway, and we're going up. 
During the week, if workers are there, it's all fine. But not on the weekend.
[2021-01-15 15:14:04] Rob Maurin: We'll go up and back literally without interacting with a single person
[2021-01-15 15:29:24] Grandpa Maurin: Hope all is well at the cottage. Have fun.
[2021-01-15 15:42:10] Omi Maurin: Enjoy!!
[2021-01-15 18:49:53] Mom Monica Maurin: I think you need to go keep an eye on things. You’re in the middle of a build. As you say, you don’t know what’s happening there. You quite honestly need to do some maintenance. :)
[2021-01-15 18:50:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Say hi to the trees for us
[2021-01-16 06:33:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning all
[2021-01-16 06:34:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Random memory of Mr. Lee getting mad at us for the basketball dropping onto his roses beside the driveway. :)
[2021-01-16 06:38:24] Omi Maurin: Yes 😉  and Rob and Pepe peeing on our rhubarb, because Mr. Lee was "steeling" it.
[2021-01-16 06:41:16] Grandpa Maurin: What bad children you were!!
[2021-01-16 06:42:22] Omi Maurin: After Mr. Lee would get mad at you,  I saw him a few times getting on his ladder and fixing the hoop for you.
[2021-01-16 06:43:38] Grandpa Maurin: What a dear old fart!
[2021-01-16 07:19:11] Mom Monica Maurin: Haha
[2021-01-16 07:20:21] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes. I was thinking this morning how he must have been enjoying the entertainment of watching the kids and talking to them and hearing us laugh or discuss things. I bet he got mad but it was all part of the fun.
[2021-01-16 07:22:15] Omi Maurin: Today is Eduardo’s and Kita’s 52nd wedding anniversary.
[2021-01-16 07:32:45] Omi Maurin: 2️⃣ more sleeps!!!
[2021-01-16 08:02:10] Grandpa Maurin: With  so much anticipation we won’t be able to sleep!

[2021-01-16 08:18:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Very excited. Keeping myself busy with address changes.
[2021-01-16 08:18:08] Mom Monica Maurin: :)
[2021-01-16 08:19:11] Grandpa Maurin: That’s my girl!
[2021-01-16 08:20:35] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks.
[2021-01-16 08:21:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Out later to buy some soap but I already have all of the other cleaning products we will need
[2021-01-16 08:21:51] Grandpa Maurin: How is the cottage, R&T?
[2021-01-16 08:22:06] Omi Maurin: I thought of felt pads for your furniture, so that the floor doesn't get damaged.
‎[2021-01-16 08:23:07] Omi Maurin: ‎vidéo absente
[2021-01-16 08:42:02] Rob Maurin: Good!
Floors are finished upstairs!
That’s about the only visible progress.  Some other basement things done, but nothing fun.

[2021-01-16 08:45:03] Rob Maurin: There’s not much we can do though.  The few bits of furniture we have are in the shipping container, and they’re blocked by other things that have to go into the basement, which isn’t ready yet.
[2021-01-16 08:45:14] Rob Maurin: So we’ll mostly take it easy for the weekend.
[2021-01-16 09:19:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Love your floors!
[2021-01-16 09:19:45] Mom Monica Maurin: Was admiring some tiles just like yours the other day!
[2021-01-16 09:31:22] Omi Maurin: Nice progress!  Congratulations!
[2021-01-16 09:32:01] Omi Maurin: Is the backup generator working now?
[2021-01-16 09:34:14] Teri Smith: Fun fact: the floors are all vinyl plank. No tiles. The backup generator is not working yet - propane is running to it, but the electrical part hasn’t been done yet.
[2021-01-16 09:34:50] Omi Maurin: Thanks! 😘🤗
[2021-01-16 09:39:10] Mom Monica Maurin: lovely!
[2021-01-16 09:42:49] Omi Maurin: I like your floor mats in the entrance 😉
[2021-01-16 09:43:42] Teri Smith: Thanks! “Hello” was from my Dad, and the other was from my brother Jeff.
[2021-01-16 09:51:35] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for report, nice looking floors, glad for progress. You can do some knitting 🧶 if you cannot move furniture and also play Sleeping Beauty so you can return to Toronto well rested.
‎[2021-01-16 09:53:16] Teri Smith: ‎image absente
[2021-01-16 10:04:56] Grandpa Maurin: Good for both of you, enjoy the peace and quiet!
[2021-01-16 10:23:24] Grandpa Maurin: Aidan and Kai, are you playing Sleeping Beauty in the sunshine?
[2021-01-16 10:32:34] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Nope up now :)
‎[2021-01-16 12:54:39] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Parking Around 720 B Kingston Road.pdf • ‎1 page ‎document manquant
[2021-01-16 12:55:22] Aidan Maurin-Jones: For when all this crap is over here is a quick overview of where parking is around our new house
[2021-01-16 12:55:41] Aidan Maurin-Jones: :)
[2021-01-16 13:05:32] Grandpa Maurin: Thank you very much, Aidan, that map will come in very handy.
I’m off to play Sleeping Beauty now. At what time can I call you this evening?
[2021-01-16 13:15:27] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Any time after 8pm should be ok :)

[2021-01-16 13:17:17] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Final version... someone (@14169067363) wanted some changes to be made...
[2021-01-16 13:48:33] Omi Maurin: Thanks Aidan
[2021-01-16 14:07:49] Rob Maurin: Nice.  Thanks Aidan.
[2021-01-16 16:26:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks, Aidan!
[2021-01-16 16:26:37] Mom Monica Maurin: EMergency orders extended another 30 days to Feb 20
[2021-01-16 16:26:38] Mom Monica Maurin: https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-extends-nearly-all-emergency-orders-under-reopening-ontario-act-another-30-days-1.5269684
[2021-01-16 16:27:03] Mom Monica Maurin: Re. Aidan's map, it turns out it's quite easy to get parking near our new place.
[2021-01-16 16:27:23] Mom Monica Maurin: Around the corner and across the street. We have never had any issue getting easy parking closeby
[2021-01-16 16:28:07] Mom Monica Maurin: Also, in the townhouse complex there are some visitor parking spots, too
[2021-01-16 16:28:12] Mom Monica Maurin: We keep forgetting about those one
[2021-01-16 16:28:12] Mom Monica Maurin: We look forward to seeing you all there one day
[2021-01-16 16:28:45] Mom Monica Maurin: I think we will have just enough time to get the house prettied up by spring and then maybe we can all sit out back. We will see what the restrictions look like then. But in any event, we will have the pleasure one day.
[2021-01-16 16:28:45] Mom Monica Maurin: :)
[2021-01-16 16:37:11] Grandpa Maurin: Right on, Monica, one day we will be all together around, perhaps, a bbq ?
[2021-01-16 16:44:41] Grandpa Maurin: Aidan, thanks for the revised map. We have printed enough copies to plaster a wall.
[2021-01-16 16:48:43] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Glad to hear :)

[2021-01-20 13:31:51] Mom Monica Maurin: We are good. Tired but good. We have made a ton of progress but it’s hard because we can’t see the finish line quite yet. But I know we will get there.
[2021-01-20 13:32:23] Mom Monica Maurin: The boys have gone to ikea and I’ve spent all day in the kitchen unpacking. Still have quite a few boxes to go
[2021-01-20 13:32:45] Mom Monica Maurin: Am really wanting to get the kitchen sorted today but I may not have the energy
[2021-01-20 13:33:07] Omi Maurin: You will get there!  No rush!  Don't overexert yourself.  You don't want your arm or leg to suffer.
[2021-01-20 13:33:38] Mom Monica Maurin: But things are going very well. As I said, we have done so much but we are still sitting in boxes everywhere so it feels like we haven’t done enough. But we will get there. We haven’t stopped. A determined group

[2021-01-25 06:36:52] Omi Maurin: A reminder that one word in the English language that can be a noun, verb, adjective, adverb and preposition.

UP

Read until the end ... you'll laugh.

This two-letter word in English has more meanings than any other two-letter word, and that word is 'UP.' It is listed in the dictionary as an [adv.], [prep.], [adj.], [n] or [v].

It's easy to understand UP, meaning toward the sky or at the top of the list, but when we awaken in the morning, why do we wake UP?

At a meeting, why does a topic come UP? Why do we speak UP, and why are the officers UP for election and why is it UP to the secretary to write UP a report? We call UP our friends, brighten UP a room, polish UP the silver, warm UP the leftovers and clean UP the kitchen. We lock UP the house and fix UP the old car.

At other times, this little word has real special meaning. People stir UP trouble, line UP for tickets, work UP an appetite, and think UPexcuses.

To be dressed is one thing but to be dressed UP is special.

And this UP is confusing: A drain must be opened UP because it is stopped UP.

We open UP a store in the morning but we close it UP at night. We seem to be pretty mixed UP about UP!

To be knowledgeable about the proper uses of UP, lookUP the word UP in the dictionary. In a desk-sized dictionary, it takes UP almost 1/4 of the page and can add UP to about thirty definitions.

If you are UP to it, you might try building UP a list of the many ways UP is used. It will take UP a lot of your time, but if you don't give UP, you may wind UP with a hundred or more.

When it threatens to rain, we say it is clouding UP. When the sun comes out, we say it is clearing UP. When it rains, the earth soaks it UP. When it does not rain for awhile, things dry UP. One could go on and on, but I'll wrap it UP, for now . . . my time is UP!

Oh . . . one more thing: What is the first thing you do in the morning and the last thing you do at night?

U

P 

Did that one crack you UP?

Don't screw UP. Send this on to everyone you look UP in your address book . . . or not . . it's UP to you.

Now I'll shut UP!
[2021-01-25 09:08:44] Mom Monica Maurin: We have heat again. Thanks everyone for your offers to help and for caring! Chat later.
[2021-01-25 09:19:50] Omi Maurin: What was wrong?
[2021-01-25 09:32:35] Aidan Maurin-Jones: The thermostat was wired incorrectly and the furnace needed some general maintenance.
[2021-01-25 09:34:37] Omi Maurin: Glad it’s working again!! 👏🏼👍
[2021-01-25 11:05:54] Kai Maurin-Jones: Haha nice one

[2021-01-27 13:32:38] Omi Maurin: Hi!
In case you are trying to phone us, we haven't had power since 12:45 or so.  It was a scheduled 15 minute power outage for the whole building, because they are working on wiring the building to be able to recharge electric cars.  I guess these are loooong 15 mins.  We haven't heard anything from the building, because the intercome works on electricity as well.   I'm surprised the Internet is working.
[2021-01-27 16:29:43] Mom Monica Maurin: Just saw this. How are you? Do you want to come stay here?
[2021-01-27 16:29:51] Mom Monica Maurin: Do you need anything ?
[2021-01-27 16:31:25] Omi Maurin: The technician is supposedly on site.  
Will see how long it takes. 
We have candles and sweaters. Thanks.
[2021-01-27 16:34:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh brother.
[2021-01-27 16:34:25] Mom Monica Maurin: I hope they fix it quickly
[2021-01-27 16:35:09] Omi Maurin: So do we!! 🙏
[2021-01-27 16:35:26] Grandpa Maurin: We are fine, do not worry, please.
[2021-01-27 16:35:36] Omi Maurin: Did your couch arrive?
[2021-01-27 17:09:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Any luck?
[2021-01-27 17:14:18] Grandpa Maurin: No, no light yet but all is well. We have plenty of candles and flashlights.

[2021-01-28 10:31:02] Mom Monica Maurin: The whole family has heat and electricity like big people?
[2021-01-28 10:31:32] Rob Maurin: So far so good!
[2021-01-28 12:30:33] Omi Maurin: We don't seem to be "big people". 😢
Although the heat pump seemed to be working,  the temperature in the condo didn't seem to go up considerably.  Francisco, the super, came this morning and reset everything for the umpteenth time (Dad had done it a few times last night and during the night) and it seemed to work...  
Again, it didn't seem to get as fast as before and I heard a faint rattling coming from the heat pump.  The "expert" was here now and determined that one piece of the pump is frozen.  He showed us the picture.  We aren't the only ones in the building with this problem.  There is nothing he can do until it thaws and he will hopefully be back this afternoon or tomorrow.  Until then we have tu put  up with the baseboard heaters, a couple of sweaters and some wine.  
The first 3 floors don't have power at all.  The condo had to rent a huge generator,  sitting on the driveway. to give power to those apartments.
[2021-01-28 12:31:54] Rob Maurin: Oh no

[2021-01-28 14:31:34] Rob Maurin: So you’ll be without power for 12 hours tomorrow?
[2021-01-28 14:32:38] Rob Maurin: No, no tomorrow.  Next week.  
We’ll be up north for our inspection.  So our house (a mess) will be empty if you need a warm place to be.

Glen (the technician) "will be in the building this afternoon"  according to an email we just received.
[2021-01-29 09:19:42] Omi Maurin: Not sure what Ulele's age was in that picture of her alone.  I guess around 40ish in the family picture.  She was 34 when she had me.

If you’re a family of 6, you’re all about to find out who’s the least favourite.

The longer this goes on, the harder it will be to return to a society where pants and bras are required.

Happy hour is starting earlier and earlier.
If this keeps up, I’ll be pouring wine in my cereal.
~~~~~
Today’s Weather? Room temperature.
~~~~~
Smoking pot and skipping school had me in trouble constantly.
Now weeds legal and schools closed ... damn kids are livin’ the dream.
~~~~~
This is stupid. I just tried to make my own hand sanitizer and it came out as a rum & coke.

If you get an email with the subject “Knock Knock”, don’t open it.
It’s a Jehovah Witness working from home.

After a few days of not going out, I saw someone I knew walking by on the sidewalk outside.
I immediately ran to the window and started yelling to them.
Now I understand dogs.

Day 8 of social isolation and it’s looking like Vegas in my house:
We’re losing money by the minute. Cocktails are acceptable at any hour.
Nobody knows what time it is.

[2021-01-30 05:57:44] Rob Maurin: Yes, it was about 15 or so in here when we arrived, so it was a civilized temperature.  
We got the fire going and it was probably 18 by the time we went to bed, so it was fine for sleeping.  
We still don’t know if the heating system is complete so we’re leaving the heat settings untouched and will regulate temperature by throwing more logs on the fire for now.

Parry Sound?  Did you go another route?

[2021-02-05 06:31:25] Mom Monica Maurin: How are you this morning mom and dad?
[2021-02-05 06:39:10] Grandpa Maurin: We are fine. We have no electricity and no heating but the temperature in the apartment is 21.5 degrees. Do not worry about us. The telephone is not working, apparently. Take care.love.
[2021-02-05 06:40:34] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. Thanks for the update. I did just try calling you and the phone didn’t work.
[2021-02-05 06:41:00] Mom Monica Maurin: How are you after last night’s dinner? Were there any leftovers?
[2021-02-05 07:12:11] Omi Maurin: It was a LOVELY dinner, thanks again to all of you!   There are chicken legs and roast beef left over for today.  We finished the ribs and sausages.  There is a small leftover of the salads and of the apple crumble.
Thanks again!!!!!
😘🤗🥰
[2021-02-05 07:18:50] Mom Monica Maurin: That’s great. We are glad it worked out well.
[2021-02-05 09:52:35] Grandpa Maurin: How are things in cottage country, R&T?
[2021-02-05 13:15:47] Grandpa Maurin: The electric power has been restored and we will have heating again . The lowest temperature we had was 20 degrees which really was not bad.
[2021-02-05 13:18:20] Omi Maurin: We have 💡
[2021-02-05 13:22:02] Teri Smith: Great news! Things in cottage country are very snowy and windy, so we’re feeling pretty lucky that we came up last night and don’t have to drive anywhere today. We’ve just hunkered down for the day, keeping cozy and warm in here.
[2021-02-05 13:23:00] Omi Maurin: Did you have your inspection??
[2021-02-05 13:25:25] Teri Smith: We did, and it went very well. He took care of everything really quickly. We've got kitchen trim now, the bedroom door closes properly, gaps with missing caulking have been filled. The only thing outstanding is that the kitchen window doesn't open. Butthe guy understandably didn't want to push it too hard, for fear of breaking it. So we'll get a window person in to look at it in the spring.
[2021-02-05 13:27:04] Omi Maurin: Great!!! Congratulations 🥳 🍾🎊🥰🤗
[2021-02-05 14:06:25] Mom Monica Maurin: Yay!! Congrats everyone!!

[2021-02-06 08:39:24] Omi Maurin: I hope that's not your car covered in snow??????
[2021-02-06 08:40:02] Rob Maurin: No, but the car looks like that I’m sure.  I’ll send a photo if we find it.
[2021-02-06 08:40:34] Omi Maurin: Wow!!  Have fun!!! Keep warm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2021-02-06 08:41:52] Grandpa Maurin: Holy shit !!!!
[2021-02-06 08:42:29] Omi Maurin: Does your car make it all the way down to the cottage?
[2021-02-06 08:43:48] Rob Maurin: Yes, because we’ve been plowing so the trades can get down.  We haven’t fully decided if we’ll keep it up once construction is complete.  But it’s a wonderful luxury to park right at the door instead of dragging sleds up and down the hill!!
[2021-02-06 08:45:05] Omi Maurin: Great!  Enjoy it!!!!
It must be so nice and spacious for you to be in the cottage, looking out,  instead of being in the bunkie.  What a luxury!!!  So happy for you!!!!
[2021-02-06 08:45:48] Rob Maurin: It is.  
We can’t believe we get to use expressions like “I’ll put it in the fridge.”
:-)
[2021-02-06 08:46:42] Omi Maurin: The indoor fridge,  not the great outdoors!!  😊
[2021-02-06 09:12:15] Grandpa Maurin: Having a clear driveway in winter is a necessity. Either you keep the plowman or hire a helicopter limousine!

[2021-02-07 09:04:53] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Amazing picture!!
[2021-02-07 11:55:08] Rob Maurin: Yes, from our shoreline looking west-ish.  
Robb and Shari have made a skating rink that we’ve been able to use, and since we’ve had 3+ feet of snow in the last 48 hours we thought it would be neighbourly to help them shovel it out.  So we loaded up the sled with shovels, put on the snow shoes, and we mushed our way over there.  Back home now.  Time for lunch and a rest.  We’ll drive home this evening.
[2021-02-07 12:01:17] Omi Maurin: Very nice!  Safe drive home!!
[2021-02-08 07:00:54] Kai Maurin-Jones: Hey everyone, if you were planning on attending (virutally, of course) the conference I'm speaking at this coming weekend (Feb 13), apparently the times mentioned before are in PST, meaning I’m actually presenting at 4:45-5pm Toronto time. Please note!
[2021-02-08 07:05:39] Rob Maurin: Good to know. Thanks Kai /

[2021-02-12 14:36:39] Rob Maurin: It was supposed to be for the weekend, but I accidentally bought the cooked ones, not the frozen ones.  So we’d better have some now!
[2021-02-12 14:57:15] Omi Maurin: They look good!!!
You can freeze the cooked ones as well.
[2021-02-12 15:23:34] Mom Monica Maurin: Did they have veg?

How did you find everything at the cottage, Rob and Teri?  Can you move in your furniture?
How is your back, Teri?
Hope you could get a good night's sleep Monica and that you aren't working too hard.
Ready for your presentation, Kai?
How are you doing Aidan?  How was your "back to work" ?
Love to ALL!!!
[2021-02-13 10:16:07] Aidan Maurin-Jones: I am good, work is extremely busy. How are you?
[2021-02-13 10:16:51] Kai Maurin-Jones: Yup 😊 ready on my end
[2021-02-13 10:35:02] Omi Maurin: Why so extremely busy Aidan?   Does it have to do with the extension of your work place?
[2021-02-13 10:35:23] Omi Maurin: Great!   We are looking forward to it, Kai!!!
[2021-02-13 11:02:06] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Precisely, the extension is near done. Now we are in the process of moving into the extension as the renovations for the original part of the clinic begin.
[2021-02-13 11:03:34] Omi Maurin: Wow!  It will look great and probably be more user friendly.
[2021-02-13 12:50:16] Rob Maurin: We’re good.  Last night was a bit of drama.  The front door lock was frozen when we arrived. 
Luckily Robb and Shari were still up, and after a few trips to their place for tools, torches and WD40 we got the door open.  
Everything is fine here, but as far as we can tell 100% unchanged from last week.  So no moving things in.
[2021-02-13 14:00:59] Rob Maurin: Woo hoo! Nice work Kai
[2021-02-13 14:01:33] Rob Maurin: Are we allowed to call you yawa?
[2021-02-13 14:04:40] Omi Maurin: Interesting Kai, thanks!!!!   I won't call you yawa!!
[2021-02-13 14:06:04] Omi Maurin: Wow, what a way to start your weekend!  Thank God for Robb and Shari.  Would you have been able to sleep in the bundie?  I guess not, because it hadn't been heated.
How was the heat situation in the cottage?
[2021-02-13 14:07:57] Kai Maurin-Jones: 😂😂 Thank you!
[2021-02-13 14:08:05] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thanks for watching!
[2021-02-13 14:08:15] Rob Maurin: Correct, it was -25 when we arrived, so it would have been a long time before the bunkie was comfortable. 
The heat in the cottage was great. It was probably 15C +/- a couple of degrees when we arrived.
[2021-02-13 14:08:34] Rob Maurin: It took everything I had to not ask a question like "Are you single?"
[2021-02-13 14:08:39] Grandpa Maurin: It was nice to see you, Kai. Keep up the good work!
[2021-02-13 14:08:58] Rob Maurin: I think you're officially the most academic person in the family now.
[2021-02-13 14:09:00] Kai Maurin-Jones: Lmao I was really expecting more of that from you hooligans. Thank you for not embarassing me
[2021-02-13 14:09:09] Rob Maurin: 🙂
[2021-02-13 14:09:12] Kai Maurin-Jones: It's just the glasses
[2021-02-13 14:31:02] Omi Maurin: I liked your glasses.  I hadn't seen them!

[2021-02-13 15:23:27] Kai Maurin-Jones: Very interesting presentation on gender-neutral pronouns and terms in Spanish happening at the conference in case anyone wants to see it!
[2021-02-13 15:23:34] Kai Maurin-Jones: For another 6-7 minutes I think now
[2021-02-13 15:39:49] Omi Maurin: Interesting.  As I only watched the tail end, it's difficult to make an opinion,  but I know that it is a very controversial matter to put the "e"  instead of an "a"  or  "o" . Can't think of a word right now. -  It seems to me that, at least in Chile,  the acceptance of the gender -neutral  "e"  is also age-related and even has a bit of political connotation...   I might be wrong.
[2021-02-13 16:13:04] Kai Maurin-Jones: Exactly! My friend Siobhan (who presented a few before me - not sure if you caught it) messaged the presenter about it, so I'm hoping to hear more about it. I'll keep you in the loop
[2021-02-13 16:14:07] Omi Maurin: 😊 thanks
[2021-02-13 16:18:27] Teri Smith: On this note, we happened to see a name of someone in the chat who had “(she/they)” after their name. I know why people put (he/him) or (she/her) or (they/them), but does anyone know what “she/they” means?? Does that mean they go by either one?
[2021-02-13 16:29:07] Kai Maurin-Jones: Yup! Seen this a few times now. As far as I know, it means they can be addressed by either of those pronouns and their according object pronouns (her/them)

[2021-02-21 08:07:33] Rob Maurin: All good here.  Bright and sunny.  A toasty -5 outside. Hot and muggy inside.  A dusting of new snow everywhere.
[2021-02-21 08:52:58] Omi Maurin: Nice!!!

[2021-02-28 09:23:30] Rob Maurin: 4 degrees apparently
[2021-02-28 09:24:51] Omi Maurin: The driveway looks almost like a highway!!  Glad to see that there doesn't seem to be pouring water down the driveway!
Safe trip home!
[2021-02-28 09:45:42] Rob Maurin: That’s the road :-)
Not out driveway.  
Our driveway is big but not that big. :-)
[2021-02-28 09:46:22] Omi Maurin: Ohhh,  that is why I found it soooo wide! 🙂
[2021-02-28 09:48:44] Grandpa Maurin: You fooled me too! , I thought it was your driveway!

[2021-02-28 12:49:55] Omi Maurin: He might still be hibernating.  Just woke up for a bit.
[2021-02-28 12:50:44] Teri Smith: They don’t hibernate! We just looked that up. Who knew?
[2021-02-28 12:54:23] Grandpa Maurin: I have an air rifle and a slingshot.
[2021-02-28 12:59:33] Rob Maurin: Maybe he just needs a cuddle
[2021-02-28 13:06:59] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Very cool!
[2021-02-28 13:37:04] Omi Maurin: Let his mommy cuddle him!!  Don't volunteer!

[2021-02-28 16:56:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Wow. Amazing

[2021-03-01 13:41:06] Rob Maurin: How's everybody faring in the wind? It's very gusty here! (All fine, just noisy.)
[2021-03-01 14:06:39] Omi Maurin: We are fine, thanks.  Very noisy as well.
[2021-03-01 14:50:15] Mom Monica Maurin: ok here. not to much of anything going on.
[2021-03-01 14:50:20] Mom Monica Maurin: time for ice cream tho
[2021-03-01 14:58:41] Omi Maurin: Dad has a colonoscopy and endoscopy Friday morning and will probably sleep the rest of the day.  He is not looking forward to it!!!!
He is due for a colonoscopy at the end of this year, but the dr. wanted it done sooner, as his hemoglobin is low.  He doesn't have any bleeding or discomfort,  but we want to make sure that his "innards" are ok.
[2021-03-01 14:59:10] Rob Maurin: Fun
[2021-03-01 14:59:28] Rob Maurin: Sucks, but I’m glad he’s getting it done
[2021-03-01 14:59:55] Rob Maurin: For the package drop off, I can leave it with the concierge
[2021-03-01 15:02:14] Omi Maurin: Let's see what Dad says when he wakes up from his nap.  It might not be necessary for you to drop off the package.
[2021-03-01 17:21:17] Grandpa Maurin: Our TD home insurance package: thank you Monica and Robert, it is not necessary for either of you to come to deliver the package to us. Everything is in order and the policy will go to our file whenever we receive it. Many thanks for your concern.
[2021-03-01 18:34:26] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. Sleep well.
[2021-03-02 07:20:31] Omi Maurin: Change of plans:
Dad has been a nervous wreck regarding his colonoscoy and especially about the endoscopy, that he has decided not to go through it.  We cancelled the appointments this morning.  Will reschedule later on.
[2021-03-02 07:25:31] Rob Maurin: oh no. Sorry to hear it's been so stressful.
[2021-03-02 08:09:48] Mom Monica Maurin: Rob says he will take it to you on Friday.
[2021-03-02 08:10:06] Mom Monica Maurin: Understood. Sorry, Dad. Fully understand.
[2021-03-02 08:11:16] Mom Monica Maurin: (Hey all, it seems my messages are not going through when I send them so they are out of order. Sorry about that. Don’t know why. I’m having some issues with WhatsApp.)
[2021-03-02 08:12:05] Omi Maurin: O don't know what order they are supposed to be in 🙂
[2021-03-02 08:12:33] Mom Monica Maurin: Ask the doctor for the poo smear kit instead. That’s an alternative test that isn’t as comprehensive but you just do some specimen gathering at home and then mail it to a lab. Easy and not at all invasive.
[2021-03-02 08:13:09] Omi Maurin: Great idea!!  Will do!
[2021-03-02 08:13:46] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes. Joe and I have done it and therefore not had to have colonoscopies.

[2021-03-03 16:26:20] Omi Maurin: GREAT!  We'll have some light lunch, if you have time.
[2021-03-03 16:26:41] Rob Maurin: I won’t come in.  Let’s play it safe for a little longer.

You are right.  Let us know when you are close and we'll meet you outside, weather permitting.  If not on P1.

But hey so far no tickets. I like that.
[2021-03-06 10:54:32] Omi Maurin: Me parece interesante. No he chequeado la información. 

Who's running the World ?
Biden,Putin and Xi were arguing on Who’s in charge of the world ?
US , Russia or China ?
Without any conclusion , they turned to "Narendra Modi" , the Indian Prime Minister and asked him Who’s in charge of the world ?
Modi replied  : *All I know is*:
1. Google CEO is an Indian .
2. Microsoft CEO is an Indian .
3. Adobe CEO is an Indian .
4. Net App CEO is an Indian .
5. MasterCard CEO is an Indian .
6. DBS CEO is an Indian .
7 Novartis CEO is an Indian 
8. Diageo CEO is an Indian .
9. SanDisk CEO is an Indian .
10. Harman CEO is an Indian .
11. Micron CEO is an Indian
12. Palo Alto Networks CEO is an Indian .
13. Reckitt Benckiser CEO is an Indian .
14. IBM CEO is an Indian .
15. Britain’s Chancellor is an Indian .
16. Britain’s Home Secretary is an Indian .
17. Ireland’s Prime minister is an Indian .
And the American Vice President is Indian .
So who's running the World ?
Very interesting !!

[2021-03-12 06:52:24] Rob Maurin: Nice.  
Yesterday morning, in Toronto, we saw a small flock of about 9 swans flying overhead and honking.   There were a few of us out on the street at the time and we all agreed we had never seen that before.
[2021-03-12 06:57:26] Omi Maurin: Nice!  Spring is in the air....
Have a nice day!!!
[2021-03-12 12:27:56] Omi Maurin: No more orders from Amazon for a while:
Peel Public Health has ordered the Amazon Canada facility in Brampton to close all shifts after determining all workers had a high-rate of exposure to COVID-19.

All employees will also be required to self-isolate through March 27 unless they have tested positive in the last 90 days and have completed their isolation period.
[2021-03-12 12:28:34] Omi Maurin: The Amazon facility at 8050 Heritage Road employs thousands of people and while the rate of COVID-19 infection across Peel has been dropping, the rate inside the facility has been increasing significantly.

The total number of cases at the facility has not been released.

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Lawrence Loh said immediate action was taken to protect the essential workers and the community.
[2021-03-12 12:29:10] Omi Maurin: “This was a difficult decision but a necessary one to stop further spread both in the facility and across our community,” said Dr. Loh.

Peel Region reported 225 new COVID-19 cases on Friday and remains in the Grey-Lockdown zone in the province’s colour-coded framework.

There have been no details on whether this will cause any shipping delays from Amazon.
[2021-03-12 12:29:57] Teri Smith: Wow
[2021-03-12 12:32:18] Rob Maurin: Omg
[2021-03-12 14:33:11] Mom Monica Maurin: Wow!
[2021-03-12 14:33:47] Mom Monica Maurin: Does this mean Amazon for you or also for us? Because if you need anything and we are still getting service, then we can order and deliver to you. Let me know.
[2021-03-12 15:08:43] Omi Maurin: I imagine for everyone, because that is a huge distribution centre.  Let's see how things develop.  We don't order that much from Amazon.
[2021-03-13 05:59:07] Omi Maurin: Daylight saving time 2021 in Canada will begin at 2:00 a.m. on
Sunday, March 14
and ends at 2:00 a.m. on
Sunday, November 7
All times are in Eastern Time.

[2021-03-15 05:46:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Ooops
[2021-03-15 05:48:33] Mom Monica Maurin: Should read: Aidan can do Monday but can do Tuesday only if we chat later in the evening (after 8:30) — which is too late. So how about we chat tonight AND tomorrow night and whoever is in is in. Wow. Crazy.
[2021-03-15 05:48:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Name a time.
[2021-03-15 07:27:17] Grandpa Maurin: We will be available for individual or group zoom or phone calls anytime until midnight. Lyndon may also call in that time frame!

[2021-03-16 08:37:05] Grandpa Maurin: Yes
[2021-03-16 13:32:23] Rob Maurin: Is an earlier time slot viable for people? Something like 6:30 would be a bit better for me. (Monica says she can make it work.) But Birthday Girl gets to choose.
[2021-03-16 13:33:22] Omi Maurin: Wwe are home and we are totally flexible.

[2021-03-16 14:30:46] Rob Maurin: ❤️
[2021-03-16 14:31:06] Omi Maurin: Yayyy !  Party for ALL!!
[2021-03-16 15:19:42] Mom Monica Maurin: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87603466510?pwd=STl4SGg0MUhyQWpvSHhZdlU4N3BFZz09
[2021-03-16 19:53:47] Omi Maurin: This is the map Dad had sent to Alex re Stoney Lake:
‎[2021-03-16 19:53:55] Omi Maurin: ‎image absente
[2021-03-17 05:36:10] Rob Maurin: Yup, that works! Google Maps shows South Bay Rd., which eventually turns onto South Bayshore Rd.
And it looks right to me, based on the two islands across the way from the end of South Bayshore.
‎[2021-03-17 05:36:49] Rob Maurin: ‎image absente
[2021-03-17 05:37:17] Rob Maurin: I do wonder if maybe the road has been extended past where it used to end, but close enough.
[2021-03-17 05:40:55] Grandpa Maurin: You may be right, Rob. I remember the cheese factory where we used to buy curds on our way back home. Everything must be so different now.
[2021-03-17 07:11:28] Omi Maurin: According to your map it looks like the road still ends at the X.  Their garage was at the end of the road and they made sure to have "no trespassing"  signs all over, so that it wouldn't turn into a road to be used especially by snowmobiles.
[2021-03-17 07:13:10] Rob Maurin: I put the X there because that's where the road ends, not because I specifically know that this is where the cottage is. 
🙂
[2021-03-17 07:13:45] Omi Maurin: Ahhh  -  We'll have to go exploring one of these days...
‎[2021-03-18 08:05:32] Omi Maurin: ‎image absente
[2021-03-18 10:39:25] Mom Monica Maurin: haha. love it.
[2021-03-19 09:54:08] Omi Maurin: Rob:  we were debating dates on when we might have been last at Stony Lake.
Dad just gave me a note where it said I worked at Pharma-Investment from 1979 to 2009.  30 years!  Unbelievable!!
1979 you went to Chile.
Wow, what a year of changes in our lifes.
[2021-03-19 10:01:27] Rob Maurin: Wow.
So our Stony Lake years would have been pre-1979? So roughly grade 4 and 5 for me at least. How many years did we make use of it?
[2021-03-19 11:20:50] Omi Maurin: I started to work at Donview the year we bought the Maverick.   Don't remember the year, but the Maverick was brand new (de paquete - as they say in Chile)
And that must have been more or less the time when the Kibedis purchased the cottage or started lending it to us.
[2021-03-19 11:22:43] Omi Maurin: And as far as I recall,  we still went to the cottage for some time while at Pharma, before Andrea sold (gave away 🙁)  the cottage to Hetty.

[2021-03-20 07:58:15] Omi Maurin: That looks LOVELY!!

[2021-03-20 09:34:23] Grandpa Maurin: Looking good !!!
[2021-03-20 09:42:00] Omi Maurin: I just had a long talk with Nena and told her that you are interested in the rocking chair.  She was very happy and she has other nice things to give you for the cottage.  She seems as excited as we are about your cottage!
[2021-03-20 09:44:19] Rob Maurin: That’s super sweet.  Thank you.
[2021-03-20 18:04:27] Omi Maurin: This afternoon we could book our appointment for our first vaccine on Wednesday March 24 at 1;50 pm.  At the same place where I took Dot.  U of T Mississauga.
Since yesterday I kept trying to see if we could book it before Monday morning when they will start officially accepting  bookings for 75+.  It worked!
[2021-03-20 18:10:16] Rob Maurin: Wonderful! Good job working the system!
[2021-03-20 18:19:00] Teri Smith: Excellent news!
[2021-03-20 20:29:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Good for you! All of you! Glad you’re getting what you need, mom and dad, and glad you got what you got, rob and Teri. :)
[2021-03-20 20:29:13] Mom Monica Maurin: Congrats.

[2021-03-22 19:28:44] Rob Maurin: A useful explanation of vaccine differences.

[2021-03-22 19:40:04] Omi Maurin: Interesting. Thanks! 😘
[2021-03-23 18:45:58] Omi Maurin: I just e-mailed you Stony Lake pictures that Teddy sent.
[2021-03-24 07:16:36] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you. Got them!
[2021-03-24 10:13:51] Rob Maurin: Elevenses = "once"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevenses
[2021-03-24 10:14:22] Rob Maurin: And apparently the 11 letters of aguardiente isn't the real reason for the name!
[2021-03-24 11:23:25] Grandpa Maurin: We just got our vaccines, we are in the recovery area for mandatory 20 minutes. All perfectly organized and smooth flowing. The needle is small, not as seen on t v and there is no pain, I liked it so much that I asked the nurse for seconds but she would not oblige !!!
We got Pfeizer vaccines and the second dose will be on July 14.
[2021-03-24 11:23:47] Rob Maurin: great!!!!!!
[2021-03-24 11:30:18] Grandpa Maurin: Monique, we hope your test is going well. Much love ❤️
[2021-03-24 11:34:25] Mom Monica Maurin: So happy for you!!! Glad to hear you had a great experience. Xoxox
[2021-03-24 11:34:38] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Great! Glad to hear!
[2021-03-24 11:34:50] Mom Monica Maurin: Just got one test done. Now sitting and waiting for the next technician for another test. Talk to you later.
[2021-03-24 11:35:31] Kai Maurin-Jones: Congratulations! Soon to be gallivanting in no time!
[2021-03-24 11:40:55] Grandpa Maurin: The only difference with the vaccination in Chile is that they do not give juice and cake or pan amasado here in Mississauga.
[2021-03-24 11:42:18] Grandpa Maurin: We were in and out in 35 minutes!
[2021-03-24 12:42:37] Teri Smith: Excellent vaccine news!
[2021-03-24 12:46:21] Teri Smith: My Dad got his on Monday morning and so far has had absolutely no post-vaccine symptoms. Hopefully it’ll be the same for you!
[2021-03-24 12:56:25] Rob Maurin: I see you got Lot ER1742. I hear that's a really good one.
[2021-03-24 12:56:30] Rob Maurin: (Yes, I'm kidding.)
[2021-03-24 14:03:02] Omi Maurin: Yes, that was a good year / lot

[2021-03-26 15:08:32] Omi Maurin: Dot already has an appointment for April 12.
[2021-03-26 15:08:43] Teri Smith: How are the vaccinated people doing? Any side effects? Just talked to my Dad - he’s had none. Not even soreness at the injection site on his arm.
[2021-03-26 15:10:09] Omi Maurin: Our arms hurt a bit yesterday and is a bit sore when we lift it, but nothing serious.
[2021-03-26 15:12:07] Teri Smith: Oh, good. Glad that’s all there is to it.
[2021-03-26 15:13:20] Omi Maurin: Apparently the second shot might give you more discomfort.
[2021-03-26 15:15:36] Omi Maurin: In Chile over 50% have been vaccinated and still the cases are increasing. 
Lockdown again as of tonight. 
Figure that!?
[2021-03-27 07:08:59] Rob Maurin: Good morning everyone
[2021-03-27 07:13:50] Omi Maurin: Good morning! 😷
Are you up north?
[2021-03-27 07:14:06] Rob Maurin: yup!
[2021-03-27 07:14:31] Omi Maurin: What’s the weather like?
[2021-03-27 07:14:59] Rob Maurin: A grey day, and most of the snow has melted to reveal the chewed up ground and construction debris. It's the ugly reality of a construction project. 

But it's beautiful inside! 🙂
[2021-03-27 07:15:28] Rob Maurin: Manny and his people will do some cleanup. Teri and I will do some too. Mother Nature will look after the garden
[2021-03-27 07:16:18] Omi Maurin: Enjoy the inside!!!

[2021-03-27 07:32:01] Grandpa Maurin: Great that the snow is mostly gone and now you can tidy up and make the ground look pretty.
[2021-03-27 15:55:15] Rob Maurin: I just saw this on Facebook:

At the East York vaccine locations, you can get on a stand-by list to get vaccines if their appointments aren’t full, even if you’re under the age threshold of the moment

[2021-03-27 20:16:01] Grandpa Maurin: Glad you’re home.Have a good sleep tonight . Love.
[2021-03-27 20:17:59] Rob Maurin: Good! Let’s all go to bed
[2021-03-27 20:18:16] Teri Smith: Excellent news. Sleep well.
[2021-03-28 04:57:16] Omi Maurin: Good morning!!
How is everyone doing this morning?  
How did you sleep Monica?
Let's hope everyone has an amazing day today!!!
Love you all!
[2021-03-28 04:58:16] Rob Maurin: Good morning.  It’s a rainy one at Poverty Bay. Love you too.
[2021-03-28 05:32:07] Grandpa Maurin: Same here, it’s a picarones and sopaipillas day.
[2021-03-28 08:02:20] Mom Monica Maurin: I want sopaipillas!
[2021-03-28 08:02:36] Mom Monica Maurin: All good here. Good night’s sleep for all.
[2021-03-28 08:02:47] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks for the help yesterday. Xox 
Have a super day
[2021-03-28 08:05:49] Omi Maurin: Glad to hear that all is good at Kingston Rd.
Have a wonderful, relaxing day!
Love !!!
[2021-03-28 08:06:35] Grandpa Maurin: Sleep the rainy day off. We owe you the sopaipillas. Do you like them “pasadas “ ?.
[2021-03-28 08:14:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Is that with chancaca? Then yes!!
[2021-03-28 08:14:49] Omi Maurin: My contribution of sopaipillas 😉
[2021-03-28 08:14:56] Omi Maurin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLv0MNW1QVU
[2021-03-28 08:16:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you!
[2021-03-28 08:31:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh yes!! So good. But we can’t get chancaca here right?
[2021-03-28 08:35:53] Omi Maurin: Not the Chilean "chancaca",  but something similar the Colombians call "panela".  A syrup with maple syrup would also do.
[2021-03-28 08:48:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Okay. I will look for panela

[2021-03-28 09:12:08] Omi Maurin: Sooo cute!!!!  ❤️
[2021-03-28 10:06:57] Omi Maurin: For sopaipilla you can also use canned pumpkin.  Plain pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling.
Not so for "porotos granados"  where you need to cook the pieces of pumpkin.
[2021-03-28 11:02:30] Omi Maurin: Just saw this posting of Hernán Burgos Jr.  on FaceBook:
Our Dearest mother Gloria Cecilia Sanchez Fernandez-Burgos passed away peacefully last night, she is now in the arms of Jesus. 
Nuestra madre falleció y esta en los brazos de Jesus.
[2021-03-28 12:08:14] Rob Maurin: Aw, that’s too bad.  RIP Tia Gloria.
[2021-03-28 12:13:56] Omi Maurin: How are you feeling today Monica??
[2021-03-28 16:59:24] Rob Maurin: I have a memory that someone we knew referred to the defogger feature in the car as a "deFROGger". Who was that? Was it a car sales person?
[2021-03-28 17:03:00] Omi Maurin: Yes, a car salesman. 🤣
Perhaps where we got the Maverick or the Buick?
[2021-03-28 18:56:16] Omi Maurin: Dad thinks it was a salesman at Addison
[2021-03-28 19:31:52] Mom Monica Maurin: I’m feeling great today. Thank you everyone for all of the love. It’s been a magical and wonderful day. Have a good sleep. Talk to you tomorrow. Xox
[2021-03-28 19:33:15] Omi Maurin: Sleep well and have a great day tomorrow.

[2021-03-30 06:49:22] Omi Maurin: Easter 2021
We guess that this coming Easter 🐇 will be yet another celebration we won't be able to get together 🙁.   Very sad, but hopefully there is a light at the end of the tunnel and soon we will be able to catch up on all the missed get-togethers.
Love you all tons!!!!
[2021-03-30 06:51:52] Grandpa Maurin: Does anyone have a simple recipe for a tasty and different rabbit stew?

Soon, soon, soon, fingers crossed. 
Love you too
[2021-03-30 10:03:39] Mom Monica Maurin: Keep watching the thermometer. When it’s warm out we can plan a picnic
[2021-03-30 16:49:43] Omi Maurin: Gerd Fiebig just sent the following message:
‎[2021-03-30 16:50:04] Omi Maurin: ‎image absente
[2021-03-30 16:50:05] Omi Maurin: Free of charge: mesa de cocina/deck 45" diametro con 4 sillas. Sillas requieren una buena limpieza o nuevo tapís. Para hijos o nietos - avisen si la quieren.
[2021-03-31 04:39:20] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh man. That’s tempting. I’m just in the process of making my dining set. So I think I will say no — but darn!!
[2021-03-31 06:12:38] Grandpa Maurin: Good choice, the cushions are contaminated with cat’s dander and whatever that causes me an allergic reaction even if I have taken antihistamines.
[2021-03-31 06:59:24] Rob Maurin: could be good for our screened room. I'd be willing to steam-clean the cushions. Let me check with Teri!
[2021-03-31 07:15:20] Omi Maurin: Gerd lives in Aurora (or Newmarket?) now.  You would have to pick it up there.  Perhaps on your way up to the cottage.  
Let me know whatever you decide.
[2021-03-31 07:24:28] Mom Monica Maurin: Go for it, dude! I noticed there's an upholsterer near the Leaside home depot --- you maybe can have it done professionally. It's a gorgeous set and a great size. That can seat 4 to 6. I would have taken it but my chairs just arrived yesterday and my table likely today. Oh well.
[2021-03-31 07:25:14] Rob Maurin: Congrats!
[2021-03-31 07:25:33] Rob Maurin: Dad, we’ll make sure you’re able to sit with us without suffering
[2021-03-31 07:26:27] Omi Maurin: Does that mean that you want it?  Shall I notify Gerd before someone else takes it?
[2021-03-31 09:55:55] Rob Maurin: Yes please! If it's still available. Could you find out if there's any urgency in getting it out of his way, please?
‎[2021-03-31 10:00:58] Omi Maurin: ‎Fiche contact manquante
[2021-03-31 10:01:45] Omi Maurin: I will let Gerd know.  I just sent you his contact, so that you can get together without intermediary.
[2021-03-31 10:01:59] Rob Maurin: thank you!
[2021-03-31 10:04:33] Omi Maurin: I notified Gerd that you are interested and that you will contact him.
[2021-03-31 10:09:25] Rob Maurin: Is he on WhatsApp? How do you communicate with him?
[2021-03-31 10:10:01] Omi Maurin: Through WahtsApp
[2021-03-31 10:10:07] Omi Maurin: or phone call
[2021-03-31 10:11:29] Omi Maurin: F.Y.I.  Gerd Jr. purchased a huge house (we haven't been there) in Newmarket and Gerd Sr. moved in with Gerd Jr. and family.  Gerd Jr.s wife is Judy and 2 children Stephan and Anna.

[2021-04-01 06:23:53] Rob Maurin: Good morning!
[2021-04-01 07:16:16] Mom Monica Maurin: Love it!
[2021-04-01 07:17:34] Omi Maurin: Are you going up to the cottage Rob and Teri?
Did you arrange something with Gerd about the table and chairs?
[2021-04-01 09:26:29] Rob Maurin: Yes, we'll head up tonight. 
And yes, I reached out to Gerd (though somehow it turned into a text message and not a WhatsApp thread...). We'll never get the table and chairs into our car, so I need to rent a van or something. I've proposed an evening next week.
[2021-04-01 15:14:42] Omi Maurin: Have a nice weekend and good luck with the table and chairs.  
Happy Easter 🐇💐❤️🌷🥰
[2021-04-02 09:25:30] Omi Maurin: https://www.blogto.com/city/2021/04/april-lockdown-ontario-2021-rules-emergency-brake/
[2021-04-02 09:25:39] Omi Maurin: Very confusing!!
[2021-04-02 09:27:30] Rob Maurin: Ugh
[2021-04-02 09:28:00] Rob Maurin: I was trying to remember: 
Who was it that gave Ulele and Nenen their names?
[2021-04-02 09:28:53] Omi Maurin: Ulele =  Alberto,  because he couldn't say Mutterle, what the older siblings used to call her.
Nenen =  Monica.  From Marilen
[2021-04-03 09:49:00] Omi Maurin: Today is Eduardo's birthday.  Also 75 years young.  Copy kat! 🙂
He doesn't use WhatsApp  only email   
edomaurin@gmail.com
[2021-04-03 10:06:55] Mom Monica Maurin: OK Thank you for saying so. I'm not keeping track of birthdays . will email him. Thanks!

[2021-04-04 06:06:33] Rob Maurin: Are you up to anything? Hunting for eggs?
[2021-04-04 06:07:41] Omi Maurin: Ha ha ha!   Just getting the eggs out of the fridge to scramble a couple for breakfast.
How about you?
[2021-04-04 06:09:24] Rob Maurin: I’ll do the same with my eggs later.  
And then it’s a work day, clearing out a bunch of fallen trees from around the new cottage.  Making things pretty for when you all can finally come up.
[2021-04-04 06:11:12] Omi Maurin: Looking forward to the day we can all go up and see your labour of love.
[2021-04-04 06:31:49] Grandpa Maurin: Have a peaceful and happy day. Good hunting for eggs 🥚!
[2021-04-04 09:01:32] Mom Monica Maurin: Happy Easter!!

No lo habíamos visto antes, porque teníamos a Megan y George de visita.

Nos gustó mucho ver un día en la vida de Kai!!
Lo vamos a volver a ver muchas veces.
Te parece que le enviemos el video a los Gutiérrez?  Creo que les gustaría verlo también.
[2021-04-10 08:58:59] Kai Maurin-Jones: 😂😂

[2021-04-10 09:42:45] Omi Maurin: Nelson’s reply:
!!!! INCREÍBLE!!  
Felicitaciones para Kai. Su español es perfecto. Maneja los verbos muy bien. Habla mejor que muchos chilenos.
Me pregunto si todo el dialogo lo habrá escrito antes de grabarlo. De todas maneras mis felicitaciones a Kai
“Keep up the good work”
[2021-04-10 10:25:38] Grandpa Maurin: Felicitaciones, Kai, muy bueno tu video. Tu dominio del español es cada vez mejor. Tu vocabulario es más extenso y tu control de los verbos que es algo difícil debido a la  declinación , es muy bueno. Ojalá podamos practicarlo pronto. Un abrazo .

[2021-04-19 12:41:40] Rob Maurin: Woo hoo! Just booked a COVID shot for Monday!
[2021-04-19 12:43:02] Omi Maurin: Woo hooo!  Where, which vaccine?
[2021-04-19 12:48:22] Rob Maurin: whatever they give me
[2021-04-19 12:48:32] Rob Maurin: but I have to assume it's AstraZeneca
[2021-04-19 12:51:56] Omi Maurin: How about Teri?
[2021-04-19 12:54:53] Rob Maurin: First you have to register your interest at the pharmacy; then if they have a slot, you get the link to book an appointment. So I had done the first step while she was on a call, figuring it wouldn't work, and I let Teri know where she could do the first step. But I very quickly got the link to book. So I booked, and I then went ahead and registered Teri. We're waiting now for her to get the link.
[2021-04-19 12:58:03] Grandpa Maurin: Good for you, R&T!!!
[2021-04-19 13:07:23] Omi Maurin: Somehow it seems to give a sense of protection... but we still have to maintain that stupid social distancing.
[2021-04-19 13:27:24] Rob Maurin: Teri got her spot. For the week after mine.
[2021-04-19 13:28:40] Omi Maurin: 👏🏼👍😘
[2021-04-19 13:35:23] Rob Maurin: "“outdoor transmission is extraordinarily uncommon,” Evans explains. “When you’re outdoors, there is essentially almost infinite ventilation. Even short-range aerosols are quickly reduced to concentrations that don’t transmit infections.”  

“Outdoor activities are great,” says Evans, a member of Ontario’s COVID-19 Science Advisory Table “For people with one dose? Absolutely. People with no doses? Yeah, it’s pretty good. People with two doses? Yeah, outside is fantastic.”

[2021-04-19 13:35:43] Rob Maurin: now that the weather is better, and you have walking sticks, maybe we can meet up in the park
[2021-04-19 13:36:00] Rob Maurin: I assume your condo board is not cool with using your condo garden?
[2021-04-19 13:39:21] Omi Maurin: You are right. No gathering in the garden. 😕
[2021-04-19 15:10:23] Omi Maurin: In the news some people driving over 3 hrs to Pickering for AZ vaccine today.
[2021-04-19 15:25:42] Omi Maurin: I can’t find the following chart for Astra Zeneca

[2021-04-20 06:06:52] Mom Monica Maurin: I just got this in an email from a lawyer on my team:
Also for anyone who is keeping track of availability there is a fantastic twitter account called @vaxhunterscanada that provides a lot of info about where appointments or walk-in are available as well as updates regarding eligibility, etc.
[2021-04-20 06:09:31] Omi Maurin: Thanks Mo!
We heard about it in the news last night. It seems to be very helpful. 
Have a nice day!!!

[2021-04-22 15:19:14] Rob Maurin: What race was Dr Huggins?
[2021-04-22 15:26:01] Omi Maurin: 🤔 Chinese/ Caribbean comes to mind. 
Dad is napping 😴 
Let’s see what he thinks
What do you say?
[2021-04-22 15:27:45] Rob Maurin: I remember Asian somehow, but I was too young to have any understanding of the nuances of race.  He had buzz-cut Asian hair and Asian eyes, and that’s all I would have been able to go on at the time.
[2021-04-22 15:28:32] Rob Maurin: But the appearance and the name — nada que ver
[2021-04-22 15:29:10] Omi Maurin: You are right. 
How did you come up with this question?
[2021-04-22 15:30:14] Rob Maurin: We were just talking about my current doctor, who Teri pictures as Asian (even though he’s not).  Which led to Dr. Huggins...
[2021-04-22 15:31:31] Omi Maurin: Let’s see what Dad remembers.
[2021-04-22 17:20:48] Grandpa Maurin: I remember Dr, Huggins well. He was definitely Chinese, most likely from Hong Kong judging by his family name. I did not have a problem understanding his speech.
[2021-04-23 04:11:01] Grandpa Maurin: The more I think about Dr. Huggins, I think that Vally is right: he was Chinese but he had been born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago 🇹🇹.

childhood in “El Orégano”.
[2021-04-30 10:20:56] Omi Maurin: Wow, amazing!  Caring for the birds, the chickens and the plants seems to be a full time job for this woman.  Good for her!
[2021-04-30 18:15:44] Mom Monica Maurin: I love watching her videos. I like her. She finds so much joy in daily life

[2021-05-10 04:56:28] Mom Monica Maurin: I think you would all enjoy this video - special delivery for Dad, too. Xo
[2021-05-10 10:01:14] Grandpa Maurin: Many thanks, Monique, a really beautiful video. I am familiar with cheese making but we used cows milk and no Pasteurization. I woke up at the crack of dawn and went to the stable for the milking of the cows. I was not good at milking the cows but participated in the routines. Then I delivered a glass with the milk on a cube of sugar to aunt Adela and similar glasses with cubes of sugar and pisco to aunt Juana and uncle Miguel! I had the milk straight, my mother refused to drink the milk because it smelled like a calf. After some milk was separated for use in the kitchen for the day, the remaining milk, 20 to 30 litres were made into fresh cheese, of course I was involved in that process. Oh , the country life !!!, you love it or hate it, there is no in between. Thanks for the memories.
[2021-05-10 10:30:23] Mom Monica Maurin: Beautiful !!
‎[2021-05-11 06:04:57] Mom Monica Maurin: ‎image absente
[2021-05-11 06:05:44] Rob Maurin: Yes please! Some, anyway.  Or you can unload everything you don’t want and I can get rid of whatever we don’t keep.
[2021-05-11 06:05:48] Rob Maurin: Thanks!
[2021-05-11 06:06:04] Mom Monica Maurin: Super! Mom and dad - do you want any?
[2021-05-11 06:06:54] Mom Monica Maurin: I will likely keep about 4 of them or so. Let me know when you want to do the transfer, rob. Are you available this aft? I can drive by. It may take me a few loads
[2021-05-11 06:08:07] Mom Monica Maurin: (They’re great for outdoor times - camping and country dwellers that store stuff outdoors. Feel free to give them to your peeps in the forest)
[2021-05-11 06:53:31] Rob Maurin: That's great. Thanks! I'm clear after 2:00. 
If you want to come by before, feel free to leave things on our porch. If either of us is off the phone, of course we'll come out and help.
[2021-05-11 06:59:20] Omi Maurin: Thank you very much Monica.  We don't need any.
Have a nice day everyone!
[2021-05-11 09:14:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. I will come by this afternoon. Will text you when en route but if you’re not available, will leave on porch
[2021-05-12 11:22:56] Omi Maurin: Just saw this on FaceBook:

[2021-05-17 07:32:19] Omi Maurin: Good morning!  How are all of you today?  Lovely weather!  How was the weekend at the cottage?
[2021-05-17 07:33:17] Rob Maurin: Sunny and mildly buggy
[2021-05-17 07:34:23] Omi Maurin: Sunny = good .  Buggy = bad
[2021-05-17 07:38:28] Rob Maurin: Yup. And the bugs will certainly get worse. But the sun was soooo nice
[2021-05-17 07:39:36] Omi Maurin: But  your sunroom is bug free, or not?
[2021-05-17 07:39:49] Rob Maurin: Yes!
[2021-05-17 12:42:25] Mom Monica Maurin: That’s great!
[2021-05-18 09:19:29] Mom Monica Maurin: Summertime! 
Mom and dad, you may wish to come earlier if you can on Friday (if it’s not raining) so that you can beat the rush hour home again. Just a thought.

[2021-05-19 16:16:49] Mom Monica Maurin: Awww. How nice. I hope you had a lovely day. I worked late and then joe came over so I haven’t called. Xo
[2021-05-19 16:18:14] Omi Maurin: Relax and enjoy your evening!!

[2021-05-20 14:19:31] Mom Monica Maurin: At the intersection of Park Avenue and Beech Avenue, you turn left into a little, free parking lot. That's where I'm hoping that you can find a spot. The way to get to that intersection is to go Lakeshore to Queen Street, then Queen all the way to Willow Ave, then turn right onto Willow and head south, following it around the bend to where it becomes Park Ave. Then follow Park Ave to Beech and right there you turn left into the parking lot.
[2021-05-20 14:19:34] Mom Monica Maurin: From this parking lot, you can walk easily to the boardwalk, or sit in the park right beside the parking lot.
[2021-05-20 14:20:04] Mom Monica Maurin: We can aim to meet at the parking lot at 11:30 AM tomorrow, if that still works for you, Mom and Dad.
[2021-05-20 14:20:47] Mom Monica Maurin: Let me know if the directions are not clear.
[2021-05-20 14:21:13] Mom Monica Maurin: (Remember that Lakeshore takes you right to Queen Street.)
[2021-05-20 15:29:28] Omi Maurin: Thanks.  I think we should find it with the GPS.  Looking forward to being together and not standing in the cold!!
See you tomorrow!  Yayyyyy!!!!

[2021-05-23 07:17:50] Omi Maurin: Yes 24 / 25 and overcast.
Is it raining up there?  It looked like you had a lot of rain yesterday?
[2021-05-23 07:19:13] Rob Maurin: It rained in the morning yesterday.  It rained hard for a short while overnight.  Partially cloudy here right now.
[2021-05-23 07:20:02] Grandpa Maurin: Enjoy it, nicely served!
[2021-05-23 07:21:08] Omi Maurin: We thought of you when Dad checked the weather report and I pictured both of you enjoying watching the rain, with a cup of coffee and nicely protected from the elements in your lovely cottage. 😊🥰
[2021-05-23 07:22:19] Grandpa Maurin: Here it’s hot, hazy and humid.

[2021-05-23 07:30:14] Teri Smith: We got those glasses last year at the Magnetawan farmer’s market yard sale thing. I think we paid $5 for 5. We had pisco sours in mind when we bought them. 😄
[2021-05-23 07:30:51] Omi Maurin: Nice!!!
[2021-05-23 08:04:13] Grandpa Maurin: Great purchase!. When we go to your cottage, if the market is open , we could make it an outing.
[2021-05-23 08:05:21] Teri Smith: We sure can!
[2021-05-23 09:55:52] Rob Maurin: So Hermann Schaub’s latest grandkid is the child of Maria Isabel.  I can’t remember whether she’s in a relationship/married/whatever.  Do you know?
[2021-05-23 09:56:23] Rob Maurin: Just temper your expectations. It’s not much more than a garage sale!
[2021-05-23 10:06:49] Omi Maurin: Maria Isabel is engaged to Tomi (don't know his last name).  They met in Australia, but both are from Concepción.  They bought a house in Conce a few months ago.  He has a auto repair shop in Concepción.
[2021-05-23 10:30:10] Omi Maurin: Thomas is Hermann's oldest. He is married to Valentina.  They have a baby girl named Olivia and they also purchased a house in Conce in the same development as María Isabel.  Thomas is a doctor, Valentina a dentist.
[2021-05-23 10:31:32] Omi Maurin: Hermann's youngest is Margarita (who was here).  Her boyfriend of many years is Gustavo, studying medicine.  Margarita is in university, but I'm not sure what she is studying now.  She has changed her mind a couple of times, I believe.

[2021-05-23 16:58:41] Omi Maurin: I just facetimed with Hermann and Paulina.  They are in Rapel for a few days.  I asked about Margarita. She is studying chemical engineering.
[2021-05-24 03:34:04] Mom Monica Maurin: the lake looks gorgeous and the cottage, too! how quickly it has all blossomed!
[2021-05-24 03:36:10] Mom Monica Maurin: Joe and i were talking about June 4th and we were thinking that we would like to to kayaking (near home) that day, weather and waves permitting. So how about we get together as a larger family group in Teri and Rob's backyard, if they are willing, in the evening -- again, weather permitting. And if the weather doesn't permit, then we find a next good day. I'm open to suggestions and further considerations but thought I'd get the ball rolling so we can all make our plans. Next we can also consider Aidan's birthday and father's day. Have I forgotten about any other June items?

[2021-05-24 06:40:17] Grandpa Maurin: Unbelievable, your cottage is incognito!
[2021-05-24 08:41:29] Omi Maurin: I would say a lot depends on the "Stay at Home order"  which now is until June 2nd, but who knows if it will be extended, as sooo many times before.
[2021-05-24 08:41:39] Omi Maurin: https://covid-19.ontario.ca/zones-and-restrictions?gclid=Cj0KCQjwna2FBhDPARIsACAEc_WrctYW_chcWutg9KzCHbFF0gw_FiGzQC9qsAFCj-Kc0YrgWvetHLkaAnLdEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
[2021-05-24 09:05:38] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh I see. Up to 5 people only. 
Ok so we will see what the restrictions are come the 4th. We can always do a quick takeout order so as to reduce the prep and be more last minute about it. 
Whatever. We can also wait until another time if that works better for everyone.
[2021-05-24 09:16:35] Rob Maurin: Sounds good to me

[2021-06-01 09:09:58] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks, Rob.
[2021-06-01 11:03:23] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey I had a neat memory last night....the foods, sights and experiences we had at Caravan. Remember Caravan?
[2021-06-01 18:10:56] Mom Monica Maurin: Does anyone have the latest info on whether we can all see each other on Friday at rob and Teri’s?
Also, this is clearly dependent on whether or not Rob and Teri feel so inclined!!
[2021-06-01 18:32:29] Omi Maurin: As far as I understand Stay at home orders finish at midnight, but not much else apparently changes. Ford might make some announcements tomorrow. 
We are game to go to Rob & Teri’s.
[2021-06-02 04:00:40] Mom Monica Maurin: The forecast calls for rain on Friday. 
I don’t know if it works better or worse for everyone, but Saturday works for me for getting together instead.
[2021-06-02 04:37:30] Mom Monica Maurin: Joe thanks it’s still only a max of 5 people allowed.
[2021-06-02 04:37:45] Mom Monica Maurin: We could also go to the lake
[2021-06-02 05:00:27] Omi Maurin: We are totally flexible and will go along with whatever, wherever, whenever the birthday kids decide.
Have a nice day!!!
[2021-06-02 06:30:16] Rob Maurin: I don't think going to the lake changes the 5-person thing, and I don't care (and our neighbours won't care), so I think we're fine to get together here still.
[2021-06-02 06:31:28] Rob Maurin: I think the weather will co-operate. Right now it looks like it might rain overnight and then clear up for the day and be warm. 
I'll order empanadas, and we can sit in the back yard.
[2021-06-02 06:31:55] Rob Maurin: Monica, what's your timing? And Aidan's and anyone else who has time constraints?
[2021-06-02 06:36:39] Grandpa Maurin: I prefer Friday evening at R&T ‘a home.

[2021-06-02 06:49:01] Omi Maurin: We can also contribute to the empanadas, cake, etc.  Let us know what we shall take care of!

[2021-06-02 06:50:43] Rob Maurin: Great. Monica, if you're willing to grab a cake, that would be nice. 
And Mom/Dad, an ensalada chilena?
[2021-06-02 06:51:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Perfect. Thank you so much! 
I can bring some drinks? Iced tea or what?

[2021-06-04 06:26:16] Rob Maurin: Small chance of a thunder shower, ending at 8:00, but I say we take the chance. We can figure out what to do on the fly.
[2021-06-04 06:26:25] Rob Maurin: So maybe aim for 6:00?

[2021-06-11 05:22:29] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
How is everyone doing?
Good luck with your appointment with the rheumatologist, Monica.  Let us know what he says.
Dad and I are ok from yesterday's shot.  The arm a bit sore, but that's about it.
Dorothy has been transferred to the Queensway hospital (Hurontario and Queensway).  I still don't understand why.  According to  her it's because there she can get stronger, so that she can go home.  It seems that I am again on the list of sole visitors.  Nobody from her family has visited.  I'll go and visit her tomorrow.
Have a nice weekend!
Love to all!
[2021-06-11 14:07:55] Rob Maurin: Thanks for letting us know about Dot.  What a family, though.  Please keep us posted, including if there’s any prospect of visiting.
[2021-06-11 14:08:40] Rob Maurin: I’m glad your shots didn’t cause more side effects. That’s great.
[2021-06-11 14:09:28] Rob Maurin: We’re driving up north soon.  It appears the stairs are finally built, so we’ve ordered railings from Brad.  We’re almost done!
[2021-06-11 14:14:19] Omi Maurin: Great!  Enjoy the weekend. Send pictures!

How are you feeling?
[2021-06-15 16:08:39] Kai Maurin-Jones: Not far, but ended up spending 8 hours ish (unexpectedly) in the sun so I am sunburnt, tired, and moving my shoulder as much as possible, but I'm well :)
[2021-06-15 16:10:19] Omi Maurin: Ouch!  Ask mom if she has glonoinum for sunburn.

[2021-06-17 06:51:34] Teri Smith: We’re struggling to book our second shots, but are working on it every day! (We’re not even eligible until Monday. On Monday, we’ll start looking at pop-ups and other options where we don’t need appointments. Hoping to lock in an appointment, though.)
[2021-06-17 06:52:35] Grandpa Maurin: HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH 
HALLELUJAH!!!!!!!!!
Vally and I have achieved full immunity to Covid 19, today .!!!!!!!!
[2021-06-17 06:53:18] Kai Maurin-Jones: I'm glad I was able to get mine on Tuesday, despite the long wait time and sunburn. Seems like the other open postal code popups have been insane since. I heard that the Jimmy Simpson one today's 2000 doses were claimed by 9am or so. Not surprising.
[2021-06-17 06:53:24] Kai Maurin-Jones: Yay! Congrats!
[2021-06-17 07:00:35] Grandpa Maurin: Well done, Kai, as inconvenient as it was. People are getting apprehensive now and rightly so.
[2021-06-17 07:20:44] Kai Maurin-Jones: Likewise. Hopefully there's more access to them for those who are interested
[2021-06-17 07:49:45] Rob Maurin: That's great! Now you can kiss strangers again, and lick the poles on the TTC with impunity!

[2021-06-22 16:55:53] Kai Maurin-Jones: I can do it! I'm really good at leaving no hairs left
[2021-06-22 17:25:33] Grandpa Maurin: That is nice to know, Kai, but I think that I will follow Mr Ford’s directions and wait for my usual stylist.
[2021-06-22 17:29:16] Kai Maurin-Jones: Too bad. Let me know if anyone changes their minds

[2021-06-24 04:58:44] Omi Maurin: https://www.saveeyecare.ca/
[2021-06-24 12:25:03] Mom Monica Maurin: Someone said recently that eye exams were covered my Ohip. Mine have never been. Am
I alone in that?
[2021-06-24 12:32:59] Omi Maurin: Regular eye exams are covered once a year. The optoochargr for a special, additional exam.
[2021-06-24 13:09:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Hmmm.  I have never had it covered my ohip. So when you go to LensCrafters they don’t charge you?
[2021-06-24 13:43:24] Omi Maurin: OHIP pays for you to have one regular eye examination every 12 months. OHIP also covers any related follow-up assessments you require before you have your next major eye examination.

OHIP Coverage for Eye Care Services - Ministry Of Health And ...http://www.health.gov.on.ca › docs › eyecare_fs_enPDF
[2021-06-24 13:46:47] Omi Maurin: Could be that what/ if OHIP covers depends on your age.  I just read the following:
[2021-06-24 13:46:54] Omi Maurin: https://www.ontario.ca/page/what-ohip-covers#section-5
[2021-06-24 13:57:09] Omi Maurin: When either one of you goes for an eye exam, remember to point out that glaucoma is in the family.  Ulele had it and so did Rudolf.  Several years ago I had laser iridotomy to relieve the pressure in the eyer and prevent glaucoma.  This was done at Bauchner Eye institute downtown.  I don't remember if it was covered by OHIP or not.  4 laser zaps and that was it!

[2021-06-27 10:46:50] Mom Monica Maurin: What a mess!
[2021-06-28 07:47:04] Omi Maurin: A bit of "important" trivia to start the week:
[2021-06-28 07:47:19] Omi Maurin: 1 .. WHY?

Why do men's clothes have buttons on the right while women's clothes have buttons on the left?

BECAUSE

When buttons were invented, they were very expensive and worn primarily by the rich.

Since most people are right-handed, it is easier to push buttons on the right through is on the left.  Because wealthy women were dressed by maids, dressmakers put the buttons on the maid's right!  And it's where women's buttons have remained since.

2 .. WHY?

Why do ships and aircraft use 'mayday' as their call for help?

BECAUSE

This comes from the French word m'aidez - meaning 'help me' - and is pronounced, approximately, 'mayday.'

3 .. WHY?

Why are zero scores in tennis called 'love'?

BECAUSE

In France , where tennis became popular, the round zero on the scoreboard looked like an egg and was called 'l'oeuf,' which is French for 'the egg.'  When tennis was introduced in the US, Americans (naturally), mispronounced it 'love.'

4 .. WHY?

Why do X's at the end of a letter signify kisses?

BECAUSE

In the Middle Ages, when many people were unable to read or write, documents were often signed using an X.  Kissing the X represented an oath to fulfill obligations specified in the document.  The X and the kiss eventually became synonymous.

5 .. WHY?

Why is shifting responsibility to someone else called passing the buck'?

BECAUSE

In card games, it was once customary to pass an item, called a buck,from player to player to indicate whose turn it was to deal.  If a player did not wish to assume the responsibility of dealing, he would 'pass the buck' to the next player.

6 .. WHY?

Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast?

BECAUSE

In earlier times it used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink.  To prove to a guest a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it simultaneously.  When a guest trusted his host, he would only touch or clink the host's glass with his own.

7.. WHY?

Why are people in the public eye said to be 'in the limelight'?

BECAUSE

Invented in 1825, limelight was used in lighthouses and theatres by burning a cylinder of lime which produced a brilliant light  In the theatre, a performer 'in the limelight' was the Centre of attention.

8 .. WHY?

Why is someone who is feeling great 'on cloud nine'?

BECAUSE

Types of clouds are numbered according to the altitudes they attain, with nine being the highest cloud.

If someone is said to be on cloud nine, person is floating well above worldly cares.

9 .. WHY?

In golf, where did the term 'Caddie' come from?

BECAUSE

When Mary Queen of Scots went to France as a young girl, Louis, King of France, learned she loved the Scots game 'golf.'  He had the first course outside of Scotland built for her enjoyment.

To make sure she was properly chaperoned (and guarded) while she played, Louis hired cadets from a military school to accompany her.  Mary liked this a lot and when she returned to Scotland (not a very good idea in the long run), she took the practice with her.  In French, the word cadet is pronounced 'ca-day' and the Scots changed it into caddie.

10 ... WHY?

Why are many coin collection jar banks shaped like pigs?

BECAUSE

Long ago, dishes and cookware in Europe were made of dense orange clay called 'pygg'.

When people saved coins in jars made of this clay, the jars became known as 'pygg banks.'

When an English potter misunderstood the word, he made a container resembling a pig.

And it caught on.
[2021-06-28 08:38:02] Rob Maurin: I just learned about Mayday the other day (it might even have been in May 😁)  but I hadn
[2021-06-28 08:38:20] Rob Maurin: hadn't ever heard about caddy. Interesting

[2021-06-29 12:18:57] Rob Maurin: Maybe the biggest hail I've ever seen, and maybe the heaviest rain I've ever seen.
[2021-06-29 12:20:50] Omi Maurin: We got it about an hr ago.  Heavy rain but no hail.
[2021-06-29 12:21:46] Rob Maurin: about the size of a pebble. Not the world's largest, by any means, but I'm glad I wasn't out for a walk!

[2021-06-29 14:00:36] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Yup
[2021-06-29 14:02:30] Omi Maurin: I hope it’s over by the time you go home 🙏
[2021-06-29 15:03:23] Omi Maurin: Posting in FB:This time of year foxes will be reported as 'carrying cats away', what you'll most likely be seeing are mums moving their kits.
If you see this then don't interrupt her or chase her to try and get her to drop what is in her mouth as she'll be moving her babies to a safer place.
Thank you to The Fox Project for the pictures 🙂

[2021-07-10 15:24:41] Omi Maurin: I just came home from visiting Dorothy.
She was sleeping, on oxygen and non responsive.  I talked to her; according to the nurse she could hear me.  I spent a bit over an hour with her, telling her about all the various "love messages" from all of you.  
She looked calm, comfortable, not in pain.
[2021-07-10 15:27:21] Rob Maurin: Wow.  
I’m so sorry it’s come to this.  
Thanks for letting us know, Mom.  
Are other visitors allowed yet?
[2021-07-10 15:36:31] Omi Maurin: They have eased the visiting restrictions a bit, but no, only  Gary, Wayne and I are allowed to visit.  To my knowledge neither Gary nor Wayne have visited.  Gary apparently is in touch with the doctor or the doctor's nurse.
[2021-07-10 15:41:54] Rob Maurin: Thanks.  Big hugs.
[2021-07-10 15:47:29] Omi Maurin: Thanks! 😘
[2021-07-11 13:12:21] Grandpa Maurin: Hi all, Mom received a call from the hospital that “Dorothy is actively dying “.  Gary was informed but will not go to the hospital. Wayne cannot be located. The nurse asked Mom if she wanted to go and she could take another person. Mom and George are on their way to the hospital.
[2021-07-11 13:26:33] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you.
[2021-07-11 13:29:25] Grandpa Maurin: Mom and George arrived at the hospital and Dorothy is still alive.

[2021-07-11 17:33:40] Omi Maurin: I’m home now.  
Dorothy was hanging on when George and I left.   One nurse told me that Dorothy would not make it through the night.
[2021-07-13 08:11:59] Mom Monica Maurin: How are you doing today, mom and dad?
[2021-07-13 08:12:34] Omi Maurin: We are fine, thanks!  How about you?

[2021-08-27 03:46:07] Kai Maurin-Jones: Saw that too. I think the intent is good but I'm kind of annoyed by that and I've talked to a few other students who feel the same way
[2021-08-27 04:08:13] Omi Maurin: I fully agree with you Kai.  Ryerson University is already known as a good institution and now a "new"  university will have to make a name for itself.
[2021-08-27 04:20:28] Aidan Maurin-Jones: You should put a “Formally known as Ryerson” thing on your if the name change happens before you graduate and leave the school.
[2021-08-27 04:22:14] Omi Maurin: Agree!!!
[2021-08-27 07:35:39] Mom Monica Maurin: I think your best bet is to wear the new name with pride about what it signifies - that we are a society trying to do better in the future - that’s a good legacy. 
If on the other hand you had to keep
Using the old name with this stigma attached it would be an unconscious mark not in your favour. 
Hopefully the new name is a good one. Wear it loud, wear it proud. 
The one thing we can be certain of is change.
[2021-08-27 07:36:28] Mom Monica Maurin: And don’t worry about legacy. U of T and lots of universities have the same name but not an entirely positive legacy to say the least

Today I had my last check-up with Dr. Weinstock (ophthalmologist).  Everything "perfect, wonderful, amazing"  according to him.  I have to agree.  Vision is not perfect yet, but will get better as days go by.  
I have an appointment at the optometrist October 2nd, for new reading glasses.

[2021-09-15 08:32:08] Omi Maurin: The following 2 messages are from Richard:
[2021-09-15 08:32:27] Omi Maurin: Hola Tios, We were so hoping to be able to come to the wedding and see you all.  Hopefully we can come soon, but these are the reasons for not coming to Canada right now …
[2021-09-15 08:32:27] Omi Maurin: Dear Cory, Jenn and Karin,

Despite being fully vaccinated, unfortunately we have run into problems for our trip to your wedding - which we were so much looking forward to.  As you know, we were planning to come just for the weekend, specifically for the wedding.

As of yesterday, the entry restrictions into Canada have been eased, but despite meeting all of the requirements, the Website states that entry is still not guaranteed.   We would still have taken the risk and come anyway.

What is a real deal-breaker however is that Europe has just now put the U.S. on the high risk list and restricted entry for non-essential travel back into Europe.  It is expected that Canada may also be put on this list in the coming days or weeks - we just don’t know and can’t run the risk of being stuck in Canada.

The required PCR test the day before travelling from Frankfurt to Germany is $200 pre person, which we would also have done.

Canada though is much more time-consuming - we would have to get to the airport about 8 hours before the flight (to get the results in time for check in), spend $282.50 per person per PCR test and hope that the results come back in time before the flight, which we would not otherwise be allowed to board.   

Despite being fully immunised, we also run the risk of quarantine after our return, should any other passenger be diagnosed with covid on our flight.

It is with a heavy heart that we therefore have decided to postpone our trip and hope that you will understand.   We also think that many of your guests would not feel comfortable with foreign travellers being amongst them at this time which is totally understandable also.

In any case, we are truly sad about it and didn’t think that so many hurdles would be put in our way after the pandemic has gone on for so long.  

We would nonetheless like to make you a nice wedding present, if you could please let us know if you have a store with a Gift wish list.

We will be looking forward to some great pictures and videos and are sure that it will be an absolutely wonderful event.

sending you lots of love,

Anette and Richard

[2021-09-16 09:16:32] Omi Maurin: Watch the performance first. 

Then read.

This performance is totally beyond belief....even without reading..

Something rather wonderful and unique to brighten your day.                   

Watch the ballet first.
 
As you watch this beautiful dance performance, please remember that the graceful Ballerina was born in 1945 - she is 75 years young. 

Not only is her performance a remarkable feat, but she is partnered with her grandson.
[2021-09-16 09:16:32] Omi Maurin: I'll blame it on my grandsons, that I can't dance like that 😘🤣

[2021-09-29 18:05:16] Omi Maurin: How do you pronounce Butte ?
Matias Schaub is coming to work  in Colorado at the Crested Butte Ski resort from December to March and he and I are not sure how to pronounce  "butte".
[2021-09-29 18:51:37] Teri Smith: It’s like the first syllable of “beauty”. Beaut. You can hear it here: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/butte

Alfonso and I had the toombstone fixed.  We didn't replace it, as this old one has history and, furthermore, is Carrara marble, which apparently nowadays is very, very expensive.

[2021-10-01 09:56:27] Omi Maurin: Just saw your Facebook picture of the water level on your lake.   
Will it go down before it freezes over?  Or will you have to leave the dock and chairs out there all winter?
I'll paste your picture here, so that the non FB members of the family can see it.

[2021-10-02 05:06:50] Rob Maurin: I’m sure it will go back down. It will be a couple of months before any chance of ice, and the water will flush out by then.  
As for the chairs, we could still walk out to the dock and get them.  We’d just have wet knees as a result.  
We’ll see together in a few days if it changes at all!

[2021-10-12 05:33:37] Omi Maurin: Hi!
There is an electric repair done in the building today and power will be shut off for a few hours.  Last time it was supposed to be "a few hours"  and it ended up being the whole day and then some for a few floors.   
Our land line might not work during the power outage, but I guess the cell phones will be ok.
Have a nice day everyone!
Good flight for Ken.
[2021-10-12 05:35:03] Teri Smith: Dad’s flight just landed in TBay! Thanks again to all for making the trip up this weekend. Good luck with the power outage.
[2021-10-12 05:36:09] Omi Maurin: WOWW, at what time did he have to be at the airport and what time did he leave?
Makes me sleepy just to think of it...
[2021-10-12 05:36:49] Teri Smith: The flight was at 7:00. We left home at 4:45.
[2021-10-12 05:37:26] Omi Maurin: 💤😴😴😴 go back to sleep!

[2021-10-14 11:06:01] Rob Maurin: They seem unwilling to completely pop the bubble, but they say "These lines mean something different for everyone" and that the ridges are "four grips to minimize slippage and spills" -- so they're definitely not confirming the measurement hypothesis.

Ulla had her knee surgery on Friday.  
They have kept her longer in the hospital, because she is in a lot of pain and hasn't been able to do physio.

Monica, you said you wanted to host.  But it’s a Thunder Bay year for us.  So did you mean you would host an early Christmas dinner on the Saturday before which we had discussed a while back? 
Or did you mean the 24th with just Mom and Dad?
[2021-11-01 22:36:06] Mom Monica Maurin: Both. I would host our early one and our 24th. But it’s up to the group if that sounds good to you. Think about it and let me know

[2021-11-18 08:11:11] Omi Maurin: The following was sent by Carmen Lía,  Nelson's niece,  to her family.  I asked if I could resend it to you:

...  Ontario has announced that they plan on allowing SYMPTOMATIC covid testing inside Shoppers Drug Marts, which is total insanity. People with symptoms, cough and sneeze during testing (without a mask) into a poorly ventilated indoor space, where other sick people go to get medicine! Insane. 

https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2021/11/16/ontario-pharmacies-to-offer-covid-19-tests-for-people-with-symptoms.html

Please go to pharmacies NOT participating in this, this is very unsafe. Wear your (K)N95 masks indoors.
[2021-11-19 08:18:58] Mom Monica Maurin: Would be better if they used some of the separate empty office spaces that are now all over the city to offer more locations. Or perhaps do what they do in Italy — they send a tester to your home so that you don’t leave it when you think you’re ill.

[2022-05-29 16:50:39] Mom Monica Maurin: You are all invited to our place for dinner on June 10 to celebrate aidan’s birthday. 7 pm BBQ. 
:)
[2022-05-29 16:51:46] Omi Maurin: GREAT!!! Thanks!!
[2022-05-29 16:53:42] Grandpa Maurin: We’ll be there, thanks.
[2022-05-29 17:22:01] Mom Monica Maurin: Yay!!
[2022-05-29 18:47:43] Rob Maurin: We'd love to, and wound certainly give it priority 99.9% of the time, except we have a double bar mitzvah that weekend in Boston, so we'll be away Friday to Sunday. We'll have to celebrate with Aidan a different time.
[2022-05-29 18:52:21] Aidan Maurin-Jones: No problem, sounds good!
[2022-05-30 01:31:59] Mom Monica Maurin: no problem. summer gets busy. we'll find another time to see you both. mom and dad, we will see you on the 10th
[2022-05-30 04:19:20] Grandpa Maurin: Yes, we will be at your home on the 10th.

[2022-05-31 04:19:59] Omi Maurin: Aidan: Tio Gustavo from Spain sent you this picture. This snake was at their doorstep today.
[2022-05-31 04:34:01] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Very cool!
[2022-05-31 04:34:38] Omi Maurin: Do you know what it is?  Gustavo says she is little, abt 25 cm long.
[2022-05-31 07:55:45] Aidan Maurin-Jones: No idea hahaha
[2022-06-01 08:36:27] Teri Smith: I’d be happy to make a cake for Saturday, if that hasn’t been planned for yet.
[2022-06-01 11:02:12] Omi Maurin: Sounds great Teri. Thanks.
[2022-06-01 13:24:47] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Hey Ya’ll, Just to let you know I just tested positive for COVID. Sorry for the wrench in the plan. Fever, headache, but sore throat. :( 🤦‍♂️
[2022-06-01 13:28:10] Omi Maurin: Soooo sorry to hear that, Aidan. 
Take care and get well soon!!!
😘🤗
[2022-06-01 13:29:42] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Thanks will do! :)
[2022-06-01 13:31:49] Rob Maurin: Ack! Get well.
[2022-06-01 13:32:17] Rob Maurin: What does that mean for the plan? Is everyone in your household locking down? i.e. are we not meeting up on the 4th?
[2022-06-01 14:18:45] Aidan Maurin-Jones: To be safe we will not be coming on Saturday.
[2022-06-01 14:32:34] Omi Maurin: 😢😢😢
[2022-06-01 15:04:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Yeah sorry. We feel we should stay home just in case -- even those who are testing negative. Just to ensure we don't spread it around. I imagine you all agree. However, we have a gift for Rob here that you guys can either pick up or we can give it to you another time. It won't go off or anything, just FYI. :)
[2022-06-01 15:06:59] Omi Maurin: Very sorry 😢!
Let’s hope Aidan will feel better soon and Kai and you won’t get it!!
😘🤗
[2022-06-01 15:08:04] Mom Monica Maurin: Right on!
[2022-06-02 05:31:21] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
How are all of you feeling???
[2022-06-02 05:31:47] Omi Maurin: Aidan getting better?
[2022-06-02 05:32:04] Omi Maurin: Mo & Kai still ok??
[2022-06-02 05:39:03] Mom Monica Maurin: Aidan had a rougher night than usual and is clearly sick but is eating cake that Kai made for him and watching videos and such -- so that's good. I'm testing negative, sore throat at times -- which could be anything for me. Kai is okay right now too. Loblaws is delivering goodies soon. We may order fresh bagels for delivery too -- so we are indulging. And we cleaned our BBQ last weekend so we may even BBQ later on if we feel like it. Something yummy to look forward to. So we have lots of lovely food and so far energy is pretty good. I'm working (law work) and Kai is studying at home today. So we are all good and taken care of. How are you all?
[2022-06-02 05:39:53] Kai Maurin-Jones: I am also negative
[2022-06-02 05:40:27] Mom Monica Maurin: yay for negativity!
[2022-06-02 05:40:38] Kai Maurin-Jones: Woo
[2022-06-02 13:50:38] Omi Maurin: How are you feeling??!
[2022-06-02 13:51:50] Omi Maurin: We’ve been out and don’t know if you have called.
[2022-06-02 13:57:13] Omi Maurin: How are you Aidan?
[2022-06-02 13:57:38] Omi Maurin: Mo and Kai still negative??

[2022-06-04 07:14:07] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you so much teri!
[2022-06-04 16:48:45] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you very much everyone for all of the nice birthday wishes and deeds! I'm happy to report that Aidan is looking much better now. He is relaxing in bed and not in the discomfort he was in all day. Kai is still doing well and busy studying and doing cool things towards his master's. And I am heading to bed again after being up a little while eating some pad thai that Kai got for me. I'm feeling okay. I'm sure tomorrow will be better. Thanks again for a good birthday. Have a good evening, everyone.
[2022-06-04 17:27:19] Omi Maurin: Thanks for the update, Mo. 
glad that things seem to be looking better. 
Get well and have a good, relaxing night. 
😘😘

[2022-06-06 13:32:37] Mom Monica Maurin: looks like you have a whole home entertainment studio on board
[2022-06-06 13:44:11] Grandpa Maurin: It is an 11.6 inches tablet style  infotainment system.
[2022-06-06 13:49:54] Mom Monica Maurin: holy smokes
[2022-06-06 13:50:02] Mom Monica Maurin: you have a lot of fun times in store

[2022-06-06 13:58:50] Rob Maurin: What did I miss? Did you finally get it?
[2022-06-06 14:04:49] Kai Maurin-Jones: Oh ya I feel like doodoo. Still testing negative but I think my streak has ended unfortunately
[2022-06-06 14:08:14] Mom Monica Maurin: these lousy boys named me MommaPooHeap
[2022-06-06 14:08:36] Kai Maurin-Jones: not boyS, just aidan
[2022-06-06 14:11:39] Grandpa Maurin: So rude !!!
[2022-06-06 14:12:02] Mom Monica Maurin: :(
[2022-06-06 14:12:07] Mom Monica Maurin: not very friendly
[2022-06-06 14:14:44] Grandpa Maurin: I’m going to play Sleeping Beauty , bye, bye.
[2022-06-06 14:14:52] Rob Maurin: Ugh! Sorry to hear that
[2022-06-06 14:16:35] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thanks, I think I'm over the hump now. Spent most of yesterday in bed and sleeping but today has mainly been some grogginess and congestion. Hopefully an upward trajectory here on out
[2022-06-07 14:38:09] Rob Maurin: How are the PooHeap sickos?
[2022-06-07 15:11:38] Aidan Maurin-Jones: MommaPooHeap and BrothaPooHeap are doing better :)
[2022-06-07 15:53:13] Mom Monica Maurin: Hehe. Thank you. Yes. Just had a shower. Squeaky clean and shiny. Starting to feel much better today! How’s everyone else?
[2022-06-07 15:54:06] Omi Maurin: GREAT!!!! 👍🥰
[2022-06-08 04:44:02] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
How is everyone feeling?
Today is Herman’s birthday. 
Have a nice day!!
😘😘😘😘😘
[2022-06-08 06:16:55] Mom Monica Maurin: Better all the time! I’m going to work a bit today. The boys seem better too. 
How are you?
[2022-06-08 06:18:10] Kai Maurin-Jones: Better! Not perfect but I slept more normally last night and this is the best I've felt first thing in the morning since Saturday. Woo! Also I've lost a bit of taste so now I'm having fun eating all the same things but it feels new and different
[2022-06-08 06:57:32] Grandpa Maurin: Good to know that you guys are all better. 🥂 🍻 cheers !!!
[2022-06-08 14:30:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Clink!
[2022-06-09 14:21:20] Omi Maurin: Do you think the following was here in TO?  I saw Canadian flags:

Are you guys going to celebrate in person, or are you still locked down?
[2022-06-10 07:00:17] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, Aidan’s bbq was cancelled. We will not meet with the Kingston Rd folks.
[2022-06-10 07:00:38] Rob Maurin: Aw, too bad.
[2022-06-10 07:11:41] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Thank you!!

[2022-06-12 07:10:47] Omi Maurin: Massive colourful birds have taken over Bloor Street
[2022-06-12 10:38:59] Rob Maurin: So fun! And they tend to match the colours of the flowers in each flower bed
[2022-06-12 10:39:33] Omi Maurin: Cute!
[2022-06-12 18:26:39] Mom Monica Maurin: i love these!!
[2022-06-12 18:26:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Still digging birds over here! :)
[2022-06-14 06:01:54] Rob Maurin: Good morning!
Are the sickos all better? And does that mean we'll be getting together for Father's Day?
[2022-06-14 06:41:43] Omi Maurin: Good morning!!
We are fine and totally flexible for Father's Day.
Have a nice day everyone.
We have a busy day, meeting Gaby in Ajax for lunch.  Picking up Teresa and Nelson on our way there.  Even Edna is joining us, taking an Uber from Stoufville to Ajax.
Love to all!!!!  😘😘😘😘😘
[2022-06-14 07:41:57] Mom Monica Maurin: I am in for Father’s Day yes.
[2022-06-14 07:42:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Have a good day all
[2022-06-14 07:44:43] Kai Maurin-Jones: I think Aidan and I are planning on seeing our Dad on the Sunday, but I believe the Saturday should work for us
[2022-06-14 07:47:45] Rob Maurin: That’s great!!! Hello to everyone
[2022-06-14 08:28:02] Mom Monica Maurin: 18th or 19th both work for me
[2022-06-14 09:01:21] Rob Maurin: Do you know, Kai, would that be a dinner thing with your dad? Would a breakfast/brunch on Sunday be an option, in Mississauga, or does that conflict as well?
[2022-06-14 09:03:01] Kai Maurin-Jones: Not sure yet. We can let everyone know tomorrow evening since we're seeing them then. Is that ok?
[2022-06-14 09:35:23] Rob Maurin: Cool, thanks. We have tickets to an event Saturday night, so we're a little less flexible
[2022-06-14 10:04:38] Mom Monica Maurin: Just a reminder everyone that tomorrow is Kai's convocation at about 3:30 PM. If we get a video link we will send it along. I don't believe there is such a thing so far, though. Just letting you know in case it all works out such that you can tune in for a few minutes. Aidan and I will endeavour to keep you posted as to what's going on in any event by typing into this chat. :)
[2022-06-14 10:05:03] Rob Maurin: Great! Please do send it, if there is one
[2022-06-14 12:22:54] Kai Maurin-Jones: https://youtu.be/Qstm1zsl6jU
[2022-06-14 17:05:09] Omi Maurin: Thanks Kai!
Congratulations !! We will be with you in thoughts!!!
Looking forward to LOTS of pictures!!
😘🤗
[2022-06-14 17:49:00] Grandpa Maurin: Would you all, please, do me a favour: forget about a Father’s Day celebration for me! . Save yourselves the stress of finding a day and time when to do it that does not overlap with other plans.
[2022-06-15 04:48:49] Mom Monica Maurin: As long as we are healthy, we would like to see you. Kai and I both felt crappy yesterday again. So we went to bed early. Once kai and Aidan have a chance to talk to Chris about their plans they will get back to us with dates and times available. We’d like to you. More on the plans tonight after graduation! Yay!
[2022-06-15 05:00:15] Omi Maurin: I hope you feel better today!   
An amazing day today, a new milestone for Kai!  
Again and again:  CONGRATULATIONS!  You did it!!!
A big, warm hug!
😘😘🙂👍👏
[2022-06-15 05:55:22] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thanks Omi!
[2022-06-15 07:06:34] Rob Maurin: Nope 🙂
We'll work it out
[2022-06-15 09:56:50] Grandpa Maurin: The following is a foreigner, probably Venezuelan, explaining the many applications and meanings of the word “raja” in Chile.

[2022-06-15 18:55:22] Teri Smith: Any update on Sunday plans?
[2022-06-15 19:02:27] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Kai and I are booked for Sunday but are free any time on Saturday
[2022-06-16 04:53:47] Rob Maurin: OK, so how about a 12:30 lunch on Saturday? 
We could do a cold picnic-style lunch. I'll smoke some meat and bring that. We can add bread, salads, dessert, and we're all set?
[2022-06-16 05:24:08] Omi Maurin: Sounds good to me!!  😘
[2022-06-16 05:58:09] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi all. We have a wrinkle. Kai and I both started feeling sicker as the evening went on yesterday. He’s pretty sick today and I’m medium sick. It looks like it’s leftovers from the last few weeks. I don’t feel comfy giving it to you all. We are doing our best to get better. Maybe we will be ok on Saturday? I have no way of knowing. What are your thoughts? Can we remain tentative and see how health goes or would you rather cancel us and meet yourselves? I’m happy to see how the next day goes and report back to you.
[2022-06-16 05:59:03] Rob Maurin: Oh no! Shitty!!!
[2022-06-16 05:59:45] Rob Maurin: Mom and Dad, I don’t want to put the weight on you, but I’d like you to make this decision based on your comfort/risk level.
[2022-06-16 06:00:51] Mom Monica Maurin: And that said, I am NOT comfy getting together if we are at all sick. So we could simply let you know on Friday night? I do not want to give whatever this is to any of you guys.
[2022-06-16 06:15:42] Mom Monica Maurin: And you could still plan to get together without us — and we will see dad and mom another time once we are all healed up.
[2022-06-16 06:20:45] Omi Maurin: Have you tested for COVID?
[2022-06-16 06:28:59] Grandpa Maurin: Monica and Kai, it’s about time you get checked and medicated by a doctor!!! What you had a few days ago may have been the common flu which was not treated properly and you cannot shake it.
[2022-06-16 06:30:23] Grandpa Maurin: Would you all, please, do me a favour: forget about a Father’s Day celebration for me! . Save yourselves the stress of finding a day and time when to do it that does not overlap with other plans.
[2022-06-16 06:31:57] Grandpa Maurin: I already told you so: no celebration for Father’s Day.!!!
[2022-06-16 06:41:15] Omi Maurin: I was not going to meddle in the plans, but I will...  😉
How about R&T bring the smoked meat for lunch on Sunday and we'll have some salads and dessert.
It is completely understandable that A&K want to spend the day with Chris.
Hopefully Monica will feel better to come on Sunday as well.
Let's get together another time to celebrate past birthdays and especially Kai's graduation.
[2022-06-16 06:44:18] Rob Maurin: That sounds great to us. Dad, if you don’t want to celebrate Father’s Day, that’s fine. We’ll just come over for lunch for the fun of it :-)
[2022-06-16 07:34:52] Grandpa Maurin: “the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry”

[2022-06-17 05:28:59] Teri Smith: What’s the new job? Details, please!
[2022-06-17 05:32:43] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Starting a new job as an iOS & Mac Technician - fixing iPhones, iPads, and Macs at an Apple Authorized Service Provider :)
[2022-06-17 05:35:32] Rob Maurin: Hey! Great news! Congrats.
[2022-06-17 05:35:55] Teri Smith: Amazing! Where?
[2022-06-17 05:37:39] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Thanks! In Ajax at a shop called Accurate Technologies.
[2022-06-17 05:38:26] Teri Smith: Excellent. Congrats and good luck!
[2022-06-17 05:39:05] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Thanks
[2022-06-17 08:49:05] Grandpa Maurin: All the best, Aidan!
[2022-06-17 11:29:41] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Thanks
[2022-06-17 11:43:00] Rob Maurin: How is everyone feeling?
[2022-06-17 11:52:03] Omi Maurin: We are fine.  Dad just texted from the vein clinic that his ultrasound (check-up) went ok! 👍🙂
[2022-06-17 11:58:49] Mom Monica Maurin: Yay for dad!!!!
[2022-06-17 11:59:26] Mom Monica Maurin: I am doing better today. 
Kai had a doctor visit since he was stilll feeling horrible. They will X-ray him on Monday to see if it’s pneumonia. Otherwise nothing for him to do.
[2022-06-17 11:59:39] Mom Monica Maurin: As far as I know Aidan is well :)
[2022-06-17 12:02:48] Rob Maurin: Poor Kai!
How are you feeling/thinking about the weekend, for getting together, Monica? Possible, or have you written that off?
[2022-06-17 12:52:00] Kai Maurin-Jones: Actually I'm going to the Albany imaging centre now to try to get the xray done today. I called and they said the wait time is usually only about 5-10 minutes, so as long as I got there before 4:30pm, they should've able to see me (the imaging centre), they should be able to see me today. Fingers crossed
[2022-06-17 12:52:32] Rob Maurin: Good luck. I hope you feel better soon
[2022-06-17 13:09:50] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thanks
[2022-06-17 13:10:03] Kai Maurin-Jones: Just got it done and I should have the results within two business days
[2022-06-17 13:13:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Good stuff kai!
[2022-06-17 13:13:30] Mom Monica Maurin: Rob, I’m feeling hopeful that I’m in for Sunday
[2022-06-17 13:13:55] Mom Monica Maurin: Will still keep an eye on things but I’m
Hopeful
[2022-06-17 13:15:33] Omi Maurin: Good for you Kai. 
Pls let us know when you get results. 
Get well soon!! 😘🥰🤗
[2022-06-17 13:16:08] Rob Maurin: Greats! 
Let’s assume you are coming, then.  
We’ll bring the smoked meat.  We can pick up bread and cheese and pastries for dessert.  What else do we want? 

We can grab… well, anything, esp if you’re not feeling great yet.
[2022-06-17 13:18:21] Omi Maurin: We’ll have a couple of salads and vegetarian balls. 
I was going to get dessert, but your pastries sound better 😉
[2022-06-17 13:19:09] Omi Maurin: Looking forward to seeing you!
[2022-06-17 13:20:44] Kai Maurin-Jones: Will do! Thanks, everyone
[2022-06-17 13:21:38] Rob Maurin: Then we’re all set!

[2022-06-18 09:31:56] Omi Maurin: How is everyone feeling today??
[2022-06-18 09:32:22] Omi Maurin: Did you go to work today, Aidan?
[2022-06-18 14:36:21] Mom Monica Maurin: i think we are all doing better. I've been out. Just arriving home. Aidan just got home from work, too. Will catch up with him now but sounds like he had a good day :)
[2022-06-18 14:37:39] Omi Maurin: Great!
[2022-06-18 16:43:55] Omi Maurin: As t what time are you planning to come tomorrow?
[2022-06-18 16:48:00] Rob Maurin: I guess we never said!
But when we were talking about Saturday, we had said 12:30

Does that still work?
[2022-06-18 16:56:11] Omi Maurin: Sounds good to us 👍🤗🥰

[2022-06-19 07:42:02] Omi Maurin: How are you feeling?
[2022-06-19 07:47:04] Kai Maurin-Jones: Not great! took an Advil Cold and Sinus and a few hits of Otravin, and it's helping a bit. Still low-energy and head still feeling like a water balloon. But all in all I'm ok 😊
[2022-06-19 07:48:40] Omi Maurin: Sooooo sorry to hear that.  Let’s hope you can shake that soon!!!
Are you taking something for allergies?
[2022-06-19 08:08:26] Grandpa Maurin: Thank you, Aidan.
[2022-06-19 08:13:52] Grandpa Maurin: Thank you, Kai, so bad to hear that you cannot shake the 🐛 🐜 🐞. Trust you get the proper medication soon to recover. Big hug !
[2022-06-19 08:34:35] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thanks. It's all good! It'll pass when it does

[2022-07-01 10:59:46] Rob Maurin: :-)

We’re good.  In slow traffic heading north
[2022-07-01 14:51:46] Mom Monica Maurin: My goodness!  I wonder what happened. Looks like the fireworks near us are still on. How about for you at Park Mansion?
[2022-07-01 14:52:52] Omi Maurin: Yes, Mississauga seems to be on!
[2022-07-01 14:53:02] Omi Maurin: How are you doing?

[2022-07-01 14:55:36] Omi Maurin: Enjoy the evening!!
😘🥰
[2022-07-03 06:06:45] Rob Maurin: Good morning. 
Bad news for the week’s plans: I just tested positive for COVID.  Teri is testing herself now.  
We already have guests up, so we’ll work out what they want to do.  I can sleep in the bunkie and maybe they’ll stay.  TBD. 

But Mom & Dad, we should cancel your visit since you haven’t already been exposed by me.  My regrets to you and George and Megan.
[2022-07-03 06:06:55] Rob Maurin: Symptomatically im barely sick at all
[2022-07-03 06:07:40] Rob Maurin: I just had a few too many micro symptoms overnight.  Headache. Chills.  Cough. All minimal but nonetheless there.  So I tested, and here we are.
[2022-07-03 06:29:28] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, I just read your message, very sad to hear that you appear to have caught Covid . Hopefully Teri will be okay. It makes sense to cancel our visit for next week and we will inform G&M. For sure we will find another date to be with you both in your cottage.
Let’s keep in touch during the day. Our love and good vibes to Teri and you.
[2022-07-03 06:54:53] Omi Maurin: 🥲🥲  I'm soooo soooo  sooooo sorry you have tested positive, Rob.  Let's hope Teri stays negative!  I hope it stays with mild symptoms.
Are your friends up, in case you need something?
Please keep us posted on how you are doing.
Lots of positive vibes for negative results!!
Love you!
Get well!!!
[2022-07-03 07:02:08] Rob Maurin: Thanks.  We actually have guests up already, both of whom had COVID in the last month, so they don’t care.  
They leave tomorrow.  
Kay and Sue are here if we need something.  

Thanks.
[2022-07-03 07:02:57] Omi Maurin: Do you have an idea where you could have contracted it?
[2022-07-03 07:03:58] Grandpa Maurin: Okay, take care!
[2022-07-03 07:05:29] Grandpa Maurin: I just called George, they send their best wishes and agree with the cancellation of our visit.
[2022-07-03 07:13:47] Kai Maurin-Jones: Oh no! Glad your symptoms are minimal. Let's hope it stays that way
[2022-07-03 07:55:43] Omi Maurin: Teri, are you negative or positive?
[2022-07-03 08:16:05] Teri Smith: I’m negative so far.
[2022-07-03 08:22:18] Grandpa Maurin: Good, keep it this way!
[2022-07-03 08:26:05] Rob Maurin: Thanks everyone
[2022-07-03 08:28:14] Omi Maurin: https://youtu.be/qb1ihzEzrF8
[2022-07-03 08:29:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Soooo sorry you guys! Just saw your news.
[2022-07-03 08:29:33] Rob Maurin: Thanks Monica
[2022-07-03 08:29:39] Mom Monica Maurin: Sore throat spray, Advil/Tylenol, sinus nasal spray — those all helped us.
[2022-07-03 08:30:30] Rob Maurin: Thank you!
I’m keeping my fingers crossed that the symptoms stay light…
[2022-07-03 08:30:33] Mom Monica Maurin: Let me know and I’m more than happy to drive up and deliver anything you need. I won’t come in but am more than happy to shuttle anything and of course happy to transport the two of you back home if you need that.  No sweat.
[2022-07-03 08:30:53] Mom Monica Maurin: Though I imagine the fresh air will do you good!
[2022-07-03 08:30:58] Mom Monica Maurin: And lots of sleep
[2022-07-03 08:31:01] Omi Maurin: Paul is the son of our friend Andres Darvasi.
[2022-07-03 08:31:03] Mom Monica Maurin: Keep in touch.

[2022-07-03 09:26:18] Grandpa Maurin: Why Boston ?
[2022-07-03 10:46:51] Mom Monica Maurin: Rob and Teri got that for Aidan for his birthday - when they were in Boston. And he loves the shirt and the hat. They are new favourites :)
[2022-07-03 13:28:41] Rob Maurin: Thank you.  Absolutely no need for that.  But thanks.
[2022-07-03 13:28:52] Rob Maurin: Yup
[2022-07-03 13:29:47] Rob Maurin: I’ll have to watch when we get back to the city.  The signal here is awful right now
[2022-07-03 14:21:23] Mom Monica Maurin: The Paul Darvasi video was really neat. I may send it to Daniela and Francisco -- especially Francisco may have some ideas he could discuss with Paul. I don't know if they know each other but we could connect them if it interests them. Do you know if Paul is in Toronto now -- I thought maybe he was in Montreal?
[2022-07-03 14:21:30] Mom Monica Maurin: I hope rob and teri are feeling well.
[2022-07-03 16:07:50] Rob Maurin: For someone with an unambiguous positive COVID test (that line was RED) I feel great.  Tired.  A little achy.  A small headache.  But compared to what you guys went through, I’m doing fine.  Thanks for asking.  

I’m really hoping that the worst is already behind (I don’t know if that’s a foolish hope, but fingers crossed).
[2022-07-03 17:07:45] Omi Maurin: Glad to hear that. Let’s keep it that way!!
[2022-07-03 17:53:21] Mom Monica Maurin: Fantastic!!
[2022-07-04 03:42:40] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Glad to here!
[2022-07-04 06:27:40] Omi Maurin: How are you all doing this morning?
Rob & Teri how is Covid treating you?
Have a nice day everyone!
Love you!!!!!
😘
[2022-07-04 07:35:30] Mom Monica Maurin: How’s everyone doing?
[2022-07-04 07:35:36] Mom Monica Maurin: We are fine
[2022-07-04 07:48:45] Rob Maurin: I woke up feeling quite a bit better. Still a little achy and tired, and I’m already looking forward to a nap.  But things are certainly moving in the right direction.  
Teri is still well.  I’m sleeping in the bunkie while Teri stays in the cottage, and we’re doing all meals in the screened room (even though the nights have been cold!) in order to minimize the amount of time we spend together indoors.  Hopefully she doesn’t catch anything.
[2022-07-04 07:49:07] Rob Maurin: Thanks for checking in.
[2022-07-04 07:49:37] Rob Maurin: How are you guys? 
I’m so sorry, M&D, that we won’t see you up here this week.
[2022-07-04 07:59:08] Omi Maurin: Glad that things seem to be moving in the right direction!!
We are also sorry that we won't go up this week, but it is wiser to do it that way.
Have a nice day everyone and get well!!!
[2022-07-04 08:09:22] Grandpa Maurin: Yes, we were sad to have to cancel our visit however, it was the right thing to do. The main thing , Rob, is that you look after yourself, play Sleeping Beauty a lot and recover. Good that Teri is unbeaten.

[2022-07-04 08:13:58] Grandpa Maurin: Dusk in Santiago after the rain. Very nostalgic!
[2022-07-04 08:15:18] Rob Maurin: Wow
[2022-07-04 08:21:02] Mom Monica Maurin: So glad you’re progressing well!
[2022-07-04 08:21:27] Teri Smith: Beautiful!
[2022-07-04 16:26:47] Omi Maurin: How are you feeling Rob & Teri?
[2022-07-04 16:29:32] Rob Maurin: I’m about the same.  Maybe a hair better.  Almost symptom-free except for minor aches and fatigue, and a bit of a cough.  

Teri is still ok, and we’re taking precautions to keep it that way.  We only hang out outdoors, or if indoors I wear a mask, and we try to minimize that.  And I’ll sleep in the bunkie again.  

I took my temp yesterday and it was 100.4.  Today it’s 99.8.  So maybe a small fever still, but getting better.
[2022-07-04 16:29:53] Rob Maurin: Thanks for asking! xo
[2022-07-04 16:30:35] Omi Maurin: Have your guests left?
[2022-07-04 16:31:45] Rob Maurin: Yes.  They left this morning.  

We still have Mike & Moe scheduled for the weekend, but they will be seeing their own parents after, and therefore maybe don’t want to risk being around me.  We’re waiting to hear their verdict on coming or not.
[2022-07-04 16:33:22] Omi Maurin: Stupid COVID making you change so many plans!  😡
[2022-07-04 16:47:02] Omi Maurin: George just called asking how you are feeling. They send good vibes.
[2022-07-04 18:02:20] Grandpa Maurin: Hello all!,
We wish to inform you that we have just bought tickets to go to Chile. We will be going with Copa Airlines via Panamá with a brief stopover to change planes. We will depart on Friday September 9th and return on Tuesday October 11th.
Much love to all!
[2022-07-04 18:49:03] Rob Maurin: Thank you
[2022-07-04 18:49:22] Rob Maurin: Very exciting!

[2022-07-05 11:56:12] Mom Monica Maurin: so are you ok today or no? i got your 12:25 'lousy connection' message but no word on how you're both doing.
[2022-07-05 11:57:05] Omi Maurin: We talked to Rob and he said he is a bit better than yesterday.  Teri is still strong.
[2022-07-05 11:59:37] Mom Monica Maurin: thanks
[2022-07-05 12:02:58] Rob Maurin: Thanks, yes.  About the same.  Maybe a bit better. So that’s a win.
[2022-07-05 12:06:48] Mom Monica Maurin: Good!
[2022-07-06 06:53:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning all. How’s everyone today? 
We are ok over here. 😊
[2022-07-06 06:54:25] Omi Maurin: We are ok in Mississauga.
Glad to hear you are ok
How are things at Poverty Bay??
[2022-07-06 07:03:34] Rob Maurin: Well…
Teri has what I had.  As of yesterday she was still testing negative (she hasn’t tested yet today) but yesterday afternoon the symptoms came on strong.  We don’t need a positive test to confirm that she’s sick. 
So far, it seems very like mine — same symptoms, similar severity.  Which is to say, manageable.  

But we’ve now cancelled the visit from Mike and Moe, which is sad.  

I continue to get better.  Just a little sore, and not much more.  Yesterday afternoon I suddenly felt much stronger and my mood lifted.  So I think I’m basically done.  Today is Day 5 (ie final day) of my required isolation.
[2022-07-06 07:26:11] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Damn thats too bad, hope you get well soon! :)
[2022-07-06 07:36:28] Omi Maurin: Soooooooo sorry to hear that now Teri is going through it. 
What are you going to do about Ken’s appointments next week?
[2022-07-06 07:39:08] Grandpa Maurin: Yes, that’s too bad about Teri.   Good that Rob is on the mend. All you can do is rest.
[2022-07-06 07:40:16] Rob Maurin: Ken arrives well enough after the onset of symptoms that he’s not concerned at all, and will come as planned.
[2022-07-06 07:40:20] Rob Maurin: Thanks everyone
[2022-07-06 07:41:08] Omi Maurin: Ok. Let us know what we can do to help. 
Have a great day!
[2022-07-06 07:52:35] Rob Maurin: Thank you
[2022-07-06 08:15:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh man! Bummer. I hope you are both feeling better really fast. 
Offers to help still stand of course. Sending lots of love and hugs.

[2022-07-07 05:13:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning. How’s everyone doing?
[2022-07-07 05:25:41] Grandpa Maurin: We’re up and running. Nothing new. How are you folks at Kingston Rd and at Poverty Bay?
[2022-07-07 05:26:57] Rob Maurin: Good morning!
I’m pretty close to 100%.  And Teri is where I was on day 3-ish: a little sore, pretty tired, some cough, some headache, but in the grand scheme not too bad.  If she continues to follow the trajectory I had, she’ll be feeling pretty normal in another 2 days.  
Thanks for asking.
[2022-07-07 05:29:46] Grandpa Maurin: Excellent news Rob , hope Teri will be fine when Ken comes.
[2022-07-07 06:30:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Great stuff!
[2022-07-08 04:18:53] Mom Monica Maurin: I hope everyone continues to do well and improve in health! Just FYI, we are on Rogers internet and it's been down for a few hours already. So if you're having trouble reaching us please phone. Have a good day.
[2022-07-08 04:20:14] Omi Maurin: Thanks Monica!
Have a nice day everyone!!
Today is Ulla's 81st birthday.
[2022-07-08 04:20:50] Mom Monica Maurin: Wow. Thanks
[2022-07-08 06:20:16] Rob Maurin: Good morning everyone.  
Our update: I’m basically normal again.  I spent a good part of the day yesterday cutting down dead trees and doing outdoorsy stuff, and it all felt normal.  Now my aches are just from being old.  
And I’m out of the isolation period. 
Teri is progressing well.  Symptoms are very light.  A little snottier today but feeling very good.  Yesterday she didn’t nap at all, compared to the previous two days when all she felt like doing was sleeping.  
Her isolation window ends tomorrow.  

So we’re on the mend.
[2022-07-08 06:35:41] Omi Maurin: Great!  Thanks for the update!!!
Have a great day all of you!!
😘🤗
[2022-07-08 06:38:06] Grandpa Maurin: Rogers is down in many parts of Canada.
[2022-07-08 06:39:52] Grandpa Maurin: Good to hear that you are back to normal, Rob, and that Teri is on the mend.
[2022-07-08 11:37:35] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Great glad to hear!!
[2022-07-08 20:44:49] Mom Monica Maurin: Glad to hear you’re getting well!
[2022-07-09 06:32:28] Mom Monica Maurin: How’s everyone this morning?
We are ok. 
As of this morning we have internet again! Yay!
I hope you have a good day.
[2022-07-09 06:36:33] Omi Maurin: Good morning!!!
Yayy for your internet Monica!  Unbelievable how this Rogers glitsch has affected everyone.
Have a nice day everyone!!!
❤️😘
[2022-07-09 07:00:31] Rob Maurin: Good morning!
We’re good.  I’m still considering myself over this.  

Teri feels basically symptomless with the exception of some snottiness and a weird skin sensitivity.  Other than that, good.  And yesterday was the last day of her mandated isolation (or maybe today, we’ll play it safe).  But in a nutshell, we’re good.  Thanks!
[2022-07-09 07:33:05] Omi Maurin: Great!! 👍👏🏼🥰
[2022-07-09 08:28:38] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for all the good news!

[2022-07-09 12:36:59] Kai Maurin-Jones: Aww you both look great!
[2022-07-09 12:52:13] Grandpa Maurin: It seems that Vally has been in the clown broth !!!
[2022-07-09 13:20:02] Rob Maurin: Where were you?
[2022-07-09 13:52:36] Grandpa Maurin: At the house of Waldo and Gina Calderon in Brampton.
[2022-07-09 14:24:22] Teri Smith: Lovely shot!
[2022-07-09 15:50:02] Mom Monica Maurin: How sweet. I'm saving that picture in my favourites. xo
[2022-07-10 08:14:05] Mom Monica Maurin: How is everyone? Interesting fact, I just learned that the Bike Share bikes network was down during the rogers shortage because their whole network is on Rogers. And Aidan's shop still had no phone system yesterday because it is Rogers dependent as well. So interesting the ripple effects.  Anyways, I''ll be doing some more reno work today. Then hoping to take it easy. Have a good day everyone. I hope Teri is all better now.
[2022-07-10 08:28:28] Omi Maurin: We are fine in Mississauga.
Just talked to Nena Kaunas.  She has covid - 93 yrs old!  She has been sick for about 10 days and doesn't want anyone in her building know that she has covid.  We offered to bing her soup, food, meds, etc. and drop things off at her door, but she doesn't want anything.  Her cleaning lady will drop off things tomorrow.  She knows what Nena likes...
[2022-07-10 08:29:14] Mom Monica Maurin: Wow. I hope she gets over it soon. Good of you to keep in touch.
[2022-07-10 08:29:46] Rob Maurin: Wow.  Poor Nena.  I hope she has a speedy recovery
[2022-07-10 08:32:13] Rob Maurin: We’re fine, thanks. Both of us are now clear of the mandatory isolation period.  I’m symptom-free and Teri is just a little snotty, I think.  I’d ask her, except she’s out paddling.  Which tells you that she’s feeling quite good.  

We’ll leave here later tonight to head home.
[2022-07-10 08:32:19] Rob Maurin: Thanks for asking
[2022-07-10 08:32:45] Mom Monica Maurin: glad to hear it. enjoy your day.
[2022-07-10 08:34:39] Omi Maurin: Glad to hear that things are better!!
Have a nice day everyone!
Safe trip home!

[2022-07-10 15:21:11] Teri Smith: I’m feeling great, thanks! No symptoms at all except I realized that maybe my sense of smell isn’t what it should be.
[2022-07-10 15:26:49] Mom Monica Maurin: yeah. we had that too -- and taste was gone. So glad you're better!
[2022-07-10 17:17:48] Omi Maurin: How did your exam go, Kai? 🤞🏻
[2022-07-10 17:18:42] Kai Maurin-Jones: It went well! I finished with an 86% in the course
[2022-07-10 17:42:47] Omi Maurin: Great!! Congratulations!!!
One more and you are done this part of your journey!! 👍👏🏼👏🏼
[2022-07-10 17:51:28] Mom Monica Maurin: Yay kaiiiii!!
[2022-07-10 17:52:03] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thank you!
[2022-07-11 05:44:32] Rob Maurin: Congrats Kai.  Is that it for the courses, or do you have one left?
[2022-07-11 05:47:03] Grandpa Maurin: Atta boy, Kai !!!
[2022-07-11 05:57:15] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thanks! Just for the Computer Science one. I'm still waiting to be able to do the exams for the Calculus one. That's out of my control at this point and I'm just waiting for them to give me a time and date
[2022-07-11 08:15:41] Omi Maurin: How are you feeling Teri & Rob?
Are you back in TO?
When is Ken arriving and departing?
[2022-07-11 09:16:28] Rob Maurin: Hi!
We’re home, and back to normal.  As far as I’m concerned, it’s business as usual.  

Ken arrives tomorrow evening and leaves Friday morning
[2022-07-11 09:37:10] Omi Maurin: Is Ken travelling alone or with Tracie?
[2022-07-11 09:38:28] Rob Maurin: Alone.  
The only real concern with that is the long walk through the airport (Billy Bishop) on his own, with luggage.  So Teri will go in and meet him at the gate with a wheelchair (whether he wants it or not)
[2022-07-11 09:38:57] Omi Maurin: Great idea!!!
[2022-07-11 09:41:19] Omi Maurin: I do want a wheelchair for our flights to and from Chile, but haven’t discovered how to book it on line yet.
[2022-07-11 11:44:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Have you asked your travel agent friends or googled how to book wheelchair assistance on your airline? I can’t right now but can help you with that later
[2022-07-11 12:03:45] Omi Maurin: No rush. Thanks!!!

[2022-07-12 16:15:54] Mom Monica Maurin: bizarre this trend!
[2022-07-14 06:25:17] Omi Maurin: A lexophile loves sentences such as, "You can tune a piano, but you can't tuna fish," and, "To write with a broken pencil is pointless." An annual competition is held by the New York Times to see who can create the best original lexophile pun.


This year's sumissions;

◾I changed my iPod's name to Titanic. It's syncing now.

◾England has no kidney bank, but it does have a Liverpool.

◾I know a guy who's addicted to drinking brake fluid, but he says he can stop any time.

◾A thief who stole a calendar got twelve months.

◾When the smog lifts in Los Angeles, U.C.L.A.

◾I got some batteries that were given out free of charge.

◾A dentist and a manicurist married. They fought tooth and nail.

◾A will is a dead giveaway.

◾With her marriage, she got a new name and a dress.

◾Police were summoned to a daycare center where a three-year-old was resisting a rest.

◾A bicycle can't stand alone; it's just two tired.

◾The guy who fell onto an upholstery machine last week is now fully recovered.

◾He had a photographic memory but it was never fully developed.

◾When she saw her first strands of gray hair she thought she'd dye.

◾Acupuncture is a jab well done. That's the point of it.

◾I didn't like my beard at first. Then it grew on me.

◾Did you hear about the crossed-eyed teacher who lost her job because she couldn't control her pupils?

◾When you get a bladder infection, urine trouble.

◾When chemists die, they barium.

◾I stayed up all night to see where the sun went, and then it dawned on me.

◾I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. I just can't put it down.

[2022-07-18 09:08:18] Kai Maurin-Jones: Yes! Not the LAST exam but part 1 (of 2) of my second last exam (if all goes well and I don't have to repeat either of them)
[2022-07-18 09:08:42] Kai Maurin-Jones: Both parts take a total of 3 days, so I'll be finished the midterm by Wednesday midday

I remember the house, but I was surprised by the aerial photo that shows the house so close to town! Was the town always that close, or has it simply grown?
[2022-07-25 06:40:40] Omi Maurin: The town has grown for sure.

I had already asked.
[2022-07-26 06:41:13] Omi Maurin: We are off to the cottage in a while. 
Returning Friday
[2022-07-26 09:53:10] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes you had asked - and kai has said this date works so I’m wondering who the date works for? Rob and Teri?
[2022-07-26 10:44:04] Rob Maurin: Yup, we’ll be there! When does Kai actually leave?
[2022-07-26 11:14:29] Grandpa Maurin: Hi there ! Just finished the first course at Webers. The other three are having ice creams. May  be coffee at Starbucks next. After all that we will resume our trip.
[2022-07-26 11:47:09] Aidan Maurin-Jones: August 22
[2022-07-26 11:47:38] Mom Monica Maurin: Kai leaves toronto on Aug 22. He’s pretty booked up near his departure date and may be going away with some friend a bit before then. So let’s do the 7th and if we can see each other again before the 22 then great.

[2022-07-27 11:07:19] Mom Monica Maurin: Here is a video of the first time she remodelled the office. Since then it has changed a bit - more offices added - but you get the gist of what we have got. :)

[2022-08-01 06:30:22] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
Today is Raj’s and Kira’s birthday 🥳

[2022-08-02 05:06:39] Mom Monica Maurin: Happy San Alfonso, dad!
[2022-08-02 05:43:13] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks, Monique, it is a day that brings back many memories of family gatherings to celebrate Tata.
[2022-08-02 06:08:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Awwww. Thinking of Tata and you both
[2022-08-02 06:08:28] Mom Monica Maurin: I hope you and mom have good appointments at the pain clinic today.
[2022-08-02 06:11:08] Omi Maurin: Thank you!
How was your commute today?
[2022-08-02 06:12:11] Rob Maurin: Happy San Alfonso!
[2022-08-02 12:47:39] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks Rob. As I mentioned before it’s a day full of many memories of family parties when we were children and later on in our early teens. Aunts and uncles were old folks, not older than in their fifties but for us they were ancient!!. How perspectives change as one ages and I wish that I could see them again and ask them the questions that nobody can answer because they are all gone.
[2022-08-02 13:21:00] Grandpa Maurin: Howdy all, we spent two and half hours at the Pain Care Clinic. Quite a bit of bureaucracy to set us up in their system. Our doctor is a young woman of Guyanese parents but born and educated in Toronto so there was no problem understanding her. She prescribed the same medication that I had brought from Chile years ago and for the time being no needles until the next appointment. In my case, the only effective remedy is needles because tablets do not work anymore. I got four shots of cortisone in my left knee. I should feel relief within three days. The right knee will be injected on August 11.
I’m going to play Sleeping Beauty to recover my strength. Hope you are having a good day.
[2022-08-02 13:24:42] Teri Smith: Hope you have success with the treatments!
[2022-08-02 13:25:04] Rob Maurin: Thanks for the update. Is the role of the pain clinic specifically about pain killers/medication? Or do they also offer physio or other kinds of intervention?
[2022-08-02 13:53:27] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks R&T . Frankly, I do not know if they offer other sorts of relief. From what I have read about my condition which the X rays have determined to be Osteoarthritis in both knees the solution is injections. The cortisone shots are meant to reduce the inflammation caused by bone rubbing on bone in the knees. The next step will be to inject the knees with Hyaluronic Acid to form a cushion to replace the worn out cartilage. These injections cost $500, and are not covered by OHIP. They are also available in Chile and I will discuss with Eduardo about having them injected by him next month. Our pain doctor said it would be perfectly alright to have this procedure done in Chile next month. Eduardo has been injecting María Elena’s knees while she is in Coquimbo.
Bye for now.

[2022-08-04 05:43:59] Rob Maurin: 🙂
[2022-08-04 05:44:36] Omi Maurin: We are flexible.  We can have brunch at Park Mansion if everybody agrees.
Monica and boys might not have a car
[2022-08-04 09:41:19] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi all, we had originally talked about lunch, no? We were thinking of hot dogs -- completos -- if you're all ok with that?
[2022-08-04 09:41:41] Mom Monica Maurin: We can host here at home or go to Park Mansion -- we were waiting for mom and dad to update us on what they feel is easiest for them.
[2022-08-04 09:42:01] Mom Monica Maurin: We are hoping the mazda repair folks have our car to us tomorrow some time. they are waiting on a part.
[2022-08-04 09:42:11] Mom Monica Maurin: So hopefully by sunday we are driving again
[2022-08-04 09:42:48] Mom Monica Maurin: let us know your thoughts - especially on timing and location that work for mom and dad
[2022-08-04 09:42:52] Mom Monica Maurin: we will go from there
[2022-08-04 10:00:18] Omi Maurin: "Completada"  sounds good to us.  We can get everything.
If you have transportation, let's do it at Park Mansion.
[2022-08-04 10:07:49] Mom Monica Maurin: Let's do it at park mansion -- 1 pm Sunday?
[2022-08-04 10:07:58] Mom Monica Maurin: later I will call you to discuss food :)
[2022-08-04 10:08:00] Mom Monica Maurin: thanks!
[2022-08-04 10:08:54] Omi Maurin: Sounds good to us!!  Yayyy!  Looking forward to it.
How much will your car repairs be?
[2022-08-04 13:41:20] Rob Maurin: Great. What can we bring?
[2022-08-04 14:45:10] Omi Maurin: How about orange juice and champagne to toast the graduate ?👨‍🎓 
I’m not sure how many “drinkers” we’ll have. 
Perhaps not such a good idea…
Any smarter suggestions?
[2022-08-04 17:01:19] Mom Monica Maurin: I will have a sip -- and as long as I am having a sip, Kai will have some, I imagine. Don't know about Aidan.
[2022-08-04 17:01:32] Mom Monica Maurin: any lovely drink is welcome.
[2022-08-04 17:01:41] Mom Monica Maurin: thank you

Plenty of leftovers for two dinners at home. The squids never make it home because I devour them , they are so good!!!.

[2022-08-13 08:58:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Yup. We waited a bit and then started walking home. The traffic was a bit chaotic but at one point I got on a streetcar and then kai intercepted me where it left off. That way he didn’t have to go into the grid lock.

More details TBD. But I thought I'd let you know in case you wanted to hold the date.
[2022-08-16 13:50:28] Rob Maurin: Mom/Dad, I will let the Gutierrezes know.
[2022-08-16 14:33:58] Omi Maurin: 👍👏🏼👏🏼 thanks for letting us know

[2022-08-17 08:31:55] Omi Maurin: Rob, do we need to purchase tickets?
How is their parking situation?
[2022-08-17 08:32:45] Omi Maurin: Purchase tickets ahead of performance or at the door?
[2022-08-17 08:43:08] Rob Maurin: Yes, the venue requires advance tickets. But the ticket link isn't available yet. I'll let you know once it's live! Capacity is small -- only 60 people. So I think we'll probably sell out. 
There's street parking only. But in the evening, I think the other businesses around are closed, so I think parking shouldn't be too hard.
[2022-08-17 08:56:23] Omi Maurin: Ok. Pls let us know as soon as the tickets become available.
[2022-08-17 08:57:16] Rob Maurin: For sure!

Will they mail them?

[2022-08-19 08:41:09] Teri Smith: As far as we remember, they do small snacky type things. Like maybe a little charcuterie plate? No full meals.
[2022-08-19 08:44:27] Rob Maurin: Not really. Like Teri says, there may be food you can order, but not much, and there's no table service I think.

[2022-08-21 07:58:35] Kai Maurin-Jones: At the moment I think I'm ok, but thank you! Just crossing my fingers everything's on time and luggage arrives and everything goes to plan. Then settling in and setting up and buying things when I get there. Thanks

[2022-08-22 16:16:17] Mom Monica Maurin: https://flightaware.com/live/flight/SWG803/history/20220823/0010Z/CYYZ/CYVR

[2022-08-22 16:18:36] Omi Maurin: Great!!! 🛫
[2022-08-22 18:30:53] Mom Monica Maurin: Kai just said "wheels up" and that now he has to go on airplane mode. Thank you everyone for all of your support and love and good wishes for Kai. xoxo Have a good night's sleep. We'll text in the morning.

[2022-08-23 06:42:01] Omi Maurin: Looking forward to details of your first day, Kai.
[2022-08-23 10:32:15] Mom Monica Maurin: I just got off the phone with kai -- he's doing great and getting set up in his new place. Weather is nice and less hot than here!
[2022-08-23 10:33:03] Omi Maurin: Great!!!  Thanks for keeping us updated!!!!
[2022-08-23 10:34:15] Grandpa Maurin: Great news, happy for him!

10 people only your family and friends 😉👍
Nelson is giving the 2 extra tickets to Alberto & Carmen Gloria Nielsen. Friends of theirs, who we have also met. He likes to ply with a group for fun. And apparently your name rings a bell to him. He described you to Nelson as tall and very good looking. I agreed that that can only be you!!
[2022-08-24 09:07:56] Rob Maurin: Wonderful.  New faces = future fans :-)
[2022-08-24 09:51:53] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Congrats!!!
[2022-08-24 11:11:58] Mom Monica Maurin: Congrats!
[2022-08-25 14:26:34] Rob Maurin: How are you doing, @14169094321 ?
[2022-08-25 15:45:13] Kai Maurin-Jones: Great! Spent several hours yesterday down on campus checking out the scenery and getting a feel for the area. Even got to the nude beach on campus (that was a fun surprise). Today busy running more errands and getting small things for the place. Spent $115 at a local dollar store so that's gotta be a new record or something

[2022-08-25 15:46:48] Omi Maurin: Wowww!  Nice! Congratulations!!
[2022-08-25 15:48:21] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thank you! It's nothing expensive (relatively speaking), but I still tried to haggle an extra $40 off the sticker price 😂 They wouldn't budge, so I refused to buy a case for it and they gave me a box instead. Just got home a few minutes ago with my laundry hamper of dollar store purchases and broken guitar box in-hand and settling in and cleaning up now
[2022-08-25 16:01:24] Grandpa Maurin: Busy, busy !!!, lots of work to get settled in and a nice feeling when it’s done. Good job, enjoy your new guitar 🎸 !!!.
[2022-08-25 16:48:38] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thank you!

[2022-08-28 18:00:01] Grandpa Maurin: These are two different languages!
[2022-08-29 12:47:30] Grandpa Maurin: Announcing Urbi et Orbi !!!
We have postponed our forthcoming trip to Chile. We do not know when our physical limitations will allow us to move freely enough to travel and get our apartment in Las Condes ready for sale.
In addition, September and October are expected to be turbulent months in Chile. We’ll discuss details when we get together.
[2022-08-29 14:40:00] Mom Monica Maurin: I’m glad you’ve made a decision. Sorry about the circumstances. We can chat more soon. Xoxoxo 
Take courage.
[2022-08-29 17:35:53] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Wow sorry to hear about your trip
[2022-08-29 18:23:04] Rob Maurin: I’m sorry it’s not going to plan, but glad you’re looking after yourselves. 
🇨🇱  🇨🇱 🇨🇱 
When is the election? Next week?
[2022-08-29 18:36:20] Grandpa Maurin: The plebiscite is on Sunday, Sept 4th. We will be voting in the Downtown Sheraton Hotel. The result: Apruebo or Rechazo will be announced about 9 p m . We will be voting Rechazo. Whatever the result may be, Monday 5th could be chaotic.
[2022-08-29 19:32:33] Rob Maurin: Have you sorted out how to get to your poll? Can I help somehow? I could drop you at the door of the Sharaton so you don't have to walk from Union or whatever...
[2022-08-29 19:35:08] Omi Maurin: Thanks!  We’ll use Sheraton’s valet parking. 
“ChezRaton” as a friend mentioned. 🤣
[2022-08-29 19:36:10] Omi Maurin: What is the best exit to take on the Gardiner to go to the Sheraton?
[2022-08-29 19:47:05] Rob Maurin: It appears to be the York/Bay/Yonge exit. And then continue to York Street and turn left.
[2022-08-29 19:48:31] Omi Maurin: Thanks

[2022-08-30 09:38:29] Mom Monica Maurin: Nice napsack and shoes. Guy has style!
[2022-08-30 12:52:58] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Looking good!
[2022-08-30 14:46:52] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thanks!
[2022-08-30 16:09:18] Grandpa Maurin: No doubt the guy has class !!!have a great day, Kai.
[2022-08-31 05:40:10] Mom Monica Maurin: Have you heard of the geography game in which each day you guess what the country is based on its shape?
Worldle…
https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/
[2022-08-31 07:28:52] Omi Maurin: Haven’t heard. Will look it up, but the English and Spanish Wordle every morning seems enough for me right now 😉😘
[2022-08-31 07:30:31] Omi Maurin: Have a nice day everyone!!
Looking forward to tonight!! 🎸 🎤🎶🎵
[2022-08-31 07:37:29] Mom Monica Maurin: Today is a good day to try worldle for the first time …. If you’re ever going to try it, today’s the day.
[2022-08-31 07:41:58] Omi Maurin: Ha, ha, ha!  You are right 👏🏼🤣😘

[2022-08-31 10:15:09] Kai Maurin-Jones: Anyone heard of them or had them before?
[2022-08-31 10:20:46] Omi Maurin: No, nunca los había visto, ni los he comido.
Son sabrosos?  Dulce o ácido?
Que lo pasen bien!
Cariños
[2022-08-31 10:22:51] Grandpa Maurin: No, never heard of or eaten dulce de tamarindo. There is a tamarind sauce that is served with samosas.
[2022-08-31 10:27:48] Rob Maurin: Same here
[2022-08-31 10:28:36] Rob Maurin: Get good Mexican food tips from him!
[2022-08-31 10:34:18] Teri Smith: Glad you’re meeting new people who share food! Curious: how big is your program (how many students?), and of the students, what’s the gender divide?
[2022-08-31 11:29:08] Kai Maurin-Jones: It was good but spicy. It's kind of sweet and spicy, and it's closer to a taffy more than a sauce. Kind of like a soft, chewy thing
[2022-08-31 11:43:19] Kai Maurin-Jones: Funny you ask this, because it's a data program, they've showed us lots of statistics about demographics of our cohorts and such. In my program, (MDSCL), we apprently have (I say "apparently" because lots of people are still struggling to get Visas, study permits, etc and still aren't in the country) 45+ people from 10+ nationalities, and the MDS-V program is 80+ people from 14+ nationalities. As far as genders, they haven't told us a breakdown of identities but at a glance it looks like about (not sure specifically, of course, but) 60/40 male/female. Lots of people from India and China, with probably North America next on the list
[2022-08-31 11:56:36] Teri Smith: Oh, interesting!
[2022-08-31 12:00:46] Mom Monica Maurin: Hmmm how neat. So nice of him to share food from home :)
[2022-08-31 12:03:43] Grandpa Maurin: Kai, get some bokchoi to share it with the Chinese women.
[2022-08-31 12:07:19] Kai Maurin-Jones: Yup! He said he brought a box of them from home (Mexico City) and usually brings them places and shares them as an icebreaker
[2022-08-31 12:07:49] Teri Smith: Love it!
[2022-08-31 12:07:55] Omi Maurin: How nice of him!
[2022-08-31 12:45:14] Grandpa Maurin: We are on our way to Astoria
[2022-08-31 13:48:31] Rob Maurin: I hope the drive is ok! 
See you soon.
[2022-08-31 14:19:21] Grandpa Maurin: Hi Rob, we are all 8 at the restaurant ready to order our food. Monica and Aidan will join us at the bar. See you.
[2022-09-01 04:46:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Great time last night, Rob! Thank you to you and your band for all the hard work. It was an evening filled with nice surprises! Thanks!
[2022-09-01 05:32:52] Omi Maurin: What a lovely evening last night!
Congratulations Rob, Lianne and Mike!

[2022-09-03 17:42:17] Kai Maurin-Jones: It was beautiful! There are a few big study buildings/libraries on campus and apparently they're all relatively new, so they're really nice. Interesting architecture too
[2022-09-03 17:43:12] Mom Monica Maurin: I love that you’re seeing some beautiful places. :)

[2022-09-03 17:53:35] Mom Monica Maurin: These are beautiful spots - rocky and rustic! So nice!!
[2022-09-03 17:58:36] Omi Maurin: Woww! I’m exhausted from just following your video!!
Lovely!!
[2022-09-03 18:02:49] Kai Maurin-Jones: 😁
[2022-09-03 18:03:33] Kai Maurin-Jones: The walk down to the beach I went to last week was similar in distance but this one felt much easier, so I think that means my cardio has gotten better. It better have with all of the walking I've been doing!
[2022-09-03 18:03:51] Mom Monica Maurin: Yayyy!
[2022-09-03 18:04:09] Mom Monica Maurin: Does that mean that our neighbourhood hills are smaller and less steep?
[2022-09-03 18:10:51] Kai Maurin-Jones: Than these two climbs? Definitely a longer distance but these are both much more intense stair climbs over a shorter time. So it's more over a shorter distance
[2022-09-03 18:11:38] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok wow
[2022-09-03 18:11:59] Mom Monica Maurin: Like doing the stairs at the ravine. Huffing and puffing. :)
[2022-09-03 19:59:25] Kai Maurin-Jones: Yup like that but for 6 minutes straight lol (that's how long the video was before I sped it up)
[2022-09-03 21:32:21] Grandpa Maurin: Thank you, Kai, for the beautiful photos and videos. Have a good sleep now. Hugs 🫂
[2022-09-04 07:22:41] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey all, Rogers is down again so Aidan and I have cell phones that work (because they are on Koodo) but otherwise no internet. It’s been like this for over an hour or so.  Just letting you know in case it’s affecting any of your stuff.
[2022-09-04 07:35:43] Rob Maurin: Ugh 
Good luck!
[2022-09-04 08:55:57] Mom Monica Maurin: Good luck with the voting today, mom and dad. Let us know how you’re doing.
[2022-09-04 09:26:22] Omi Maurin: Done!! 🇨🇱🇨🇦
All well! Valet parking great!!
[2022-09-04 10:04:30] Mom Monica Maurin: That's wonderful! So happy to hear of your success!
[2022-09-04 10:04:40] Mom Monica Maurin: I hope traffic heading home is good to you.
[2022-09-04 13:40:48] Omi Maurin: Valet parking was “on the house”!  They couldn’t find our car 😟
The guy who received the car “forgot to register it…”. 
Traffic was good.
[2022-09-04 14:46:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh my! That must have been scary.
[2022-09-04 14:46:57] Mom Monica Maurin: We are still with the Kibedis - in keswick. Talk soon. Xo
[2022-09-04 14:47:32] Rob Maurin: !!!!

How long did it take to get it back?
[2022-09-04 14:47:43] Rob Maurin: Please say hi for us!
[2022-09-04 14:56:45] Omi Maurin: Not too long. I think Dad was more worried than I.
[2022-09-04 14:57:45] Omi Maurin: Are you sure you have enough food?? 🤣Have fun! Say HI!
[2022-09-04 17:57:51] Mom Monica Maurin: Haha!! We had enough :)
We had a lovely time. Everyone says hi!!
[2022-09-04 17:57:57] Mom Monica Maurin: We just got home.

[2022-09-05 08:28:37] Omi Maurin: Rob, do you have another presentation in October?
Nelson mentioned something.
[2022-09-05 08:37:46] Rob Maurin: Ha, funny. I was sending some thank-yous via email late last night, including to Nelson and Teresa. And I was going to send you all another thank-you for coming, but via WhatsApp. But it was too late to send a WhatsApp; I didn't want to wake you. 
Which is how Nelson got the news before you. 

Yes, we've been booked in for a show at Reid's on October 12. 
Tickets aren't on sale yet. It will take Reid's a couple of days to get that up, I assume.
[2022-09-05 08:38:41] Rob Maurin: So:
Thank you all, again, for coming! I really appreciate it. 
Please don't feel an obligation to come to these shows, which I hope will be a regular thing. But yes, the next show is October 12, at Reid's/
[2022-09-05 09:51:12] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, I had already marked my calendar with your October 12 performance when I realized that the next day I have a 9:00 a m appointment with the retina surgeon in the Oakville hospital. This means getting up extra early to be at the hospital for the preliminaries prior to the consultation. I do not want to postpone the appointment because it would be another bunch of months wait. I regret that we cannot attend your show this time and hope that a future one will come up soon.
[2022-09-05 10:04:44] Rob Maurin: Understood! 
Let me know if you need any help for the appointment?
[2022-09-05 10:15:51] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, Thanks for your offer. We do not need anything other than getting up very early.
[2022-09-05 10:25:21] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, you said that you did not want to send us a WhatsApp message because it was too late and you might have wakened us up. Not to
worry, we do not sleep with the cellular phones in our night tables and we silence them anyways. The only live phone we have on at night is the land line.
[2022-09-05 17:37:27] Mom Monica Maurin: Congrats rob. I think Aidan and I will join you on the 12
[2022-09-05 17:37:59] Mom Monica Maurin: Same as dad, my phone doesn’t ring for WhatsApp so fire away messages as late as you like. All we be silent unless you phone me.
[2022-09-05 17:38:01] Mom Monica Maurin: Night all

[2022-09-07 18:14:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Good night, all. xo

[2022-09-09 07:44:24] Mom Monica Maurin: That's really a neat video, dad. 1968!  And like so many videos of the time, there are many shots of young women in bikinis, even though that has nothing to do with anything. :). Thanks for sharing.
[2022-09-09 09:08:18] Mom Monica Maurin: thanksgiving plans anyone? just wanted to get family stuff into my calendar so that I know when to book other things around it.

[2022-09-09 20:17:46] Mom Monica Maurin: Argh!! I would not have known that. But I often still guess right. However, I ran out of lines for guessing and then the game ended and didn't show me the word. Thank you!
[2022-09-09 20:17:49] Mom Monica Maurin: night night.

[2022-09-11 06:49:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Haha!!
[2022-09-11 07:44:37] Rob Maurin: We’re 100% flexible too.  We would happily host as well, either in Toronto or at the lake.  
Mom/Dad, do you want to make the decision?
[2022-09-11 07:47:33] Omi Maurin: We’ll discuss it and let you know.  Thanks.
[2022-09-11 12:38:42] Omi Maurin: What dates would you have in mind if we take you up to spend Thanksgiving at the cottage?
[2022-09-11 12:43:05] Teri Smith: We are totally flexible. Whatever works for you all.
[2022-09-11 16:26:31] Rob Maurin: Yes, we could make just about anything work.  So if this is something you all would like, let us know dates that work for you!
[2022-09-11 16:29:09] Omi Maurin: Monica and Aidan are going to check their work schedules and will let us know. 
We are flexible.
[2022-09-11 16:34:04] Rob Maurin: Cool! 
Whatever brings people the most peace and happiness.
[2022-09-11 16:34:14] Omi Maurin: Tomorrow is Ana Mary’s birthday. 
We didn’t hear anything about Macarena in the afternoon.
[2022-09-11 16:34:33] Omi Maurin: 👍👏🏼😘😘
[2022-09-12 06:16:19] Mom Monica Maurin: Will get back to you Later today or tomorrow w dates. Aidan and I are in for the cottage likely for one overnight. Will update y’all soon
[2022-09-12 06:16:21] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks!

[2022-09-15 17:39:06] Mom Monica Maurin: Re thanks giving, Aidan and I can drive up to the cottage on the Saturday 8th and come back to Toronto midday on the 9th. We have to work on Friday and Aidan has stuff with Chris on the Monday. 
We can go and pick up mom and dad if they want to go by that timeline. Otherwise Aidan and I can go up on our own - it would prob be good for my car to run a bit. But if you want me to drive you Mom and Dad, that’s fine and Aidan and I can go get you and bring you back. Let me know.
[2022-09-15 19:53:42] Rob Maurin: That's a lot of driving in a short time, but you guys make the call. We're happy to have you here for however long, and also happy to do it in the city. Either way, yay!
[2022-09-16 07:41:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you. We only have those days and we are happy to do the driving. Enjoying the driving as well as the visit with everyone is the plan
[2022-09-16 09:00:47] Grandpa Maurin: Monique , regarding your itinerary to and from the cottage, thanks but we do not agree with it. That is a lot of driving with very little rest in between trips. We can celebrate on Sunday at R&T’s home in Toronto or at Park Mansion.

[2022-09-16 14:21:11] Rob Maurin: We’ll find out! 
;-)
[2022-09-16 14:21:45] Grandpa Maurin: Not funny !!!
[2022-09-16 14:21:59] Rob Maurin: But yes, we’ve had confirmation from friends who know.  And I looked up what fungi might be confused with it, and I know what to look for to be sure
[2022-09-16 14:23:25] Rob Maurin: https://unrulygardening.com/chicken-of-the-woods-mushroom/
[2022-09-16 14:23:56] Rob Maurin: We have the Laetiporus sulphureus
[2022-09-16 14:24:19] Rob Maurin: It has no gills on the underside
[2022-09-16 14:33:08] Grandpa Maurin: Do not eat too much, anyway.   Make sure you have gasoline in your car and know where to go for first aid.
[2022-09-16 14:35:29] Grandpa Maurin: I don’t get it, I must have seen too many mushrooms and they have impaired my brain!
[2022-09-16 14:51:48] Teri Smith: Kai, how’s it going out on the west coast?
[2022-09-16 15:08:52] Omi Maurin: Woww, beautiful!  Are you sure you want to eat it?  It's making me nervous!!!
[2022-09-16 15:10:54] Omi Maurin: We received an email from Copa and apparently they are going to refund us 100% of what we paid for our unused tickets to fly to Chile.  They say it might take 2 or 3 statements until we see the credit on our credit card statement.  🤞
[2022-09-16 15:11:59] Omi Maurin: Mushrooms do that to Tupperware!  Beware!!  😘
[2022-09-16 15:28:55] Kai Maurin-Jones: Things are good! Crazy busy and I have my first exams (in addition to regular workload) next week. We have the Monday off here, so instead of Mon-Thurs, I have classes and exams next week from Tues-Fri. I've learned a ton so far and things are going a mile a minute and feeling like I'm in a constant state of catch-up, but I'm enjoying it!

[2022-09-17 03:01:35] Mom Monica Maurin: Those mushrooms look beautiful! What a find!!
[2022-09-17 05:49:14] Grandpa Maurin: R&T, how are you feeling today?
[2022-09-17 05:55:57] Rob Maurin: Thanks for asking.  :-)

All good.  

I want to be a smart-ass and say something like “the bleeding has mostly stopped, just a bit from my eyes this morning.”

But no.  We’re 100% fine.  Thanks.
[2022-09-17 05:56:32] Rob Maurin: It’s lumberjack weekend.  We’re on our way to help the neighbours chop firewood.

[2022-09-19 08:14:16] Omi Maurin: Yes, since 5 am
And since 9 am the Parada Militar in Chile.
[2022-09-19 08:14:38] Rob Maurin: Busy day!
[2022-09-19 08:14:58] Omi Maurin: How are you doing, Teri?  How is your thumb? 👍🤞🏻
[2022-09-19 08:15:27] Omi Maurin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_VH8yRaT70
[2022-09-19 08:29:09] Teri Smith: I slept much better last night and made it all the way through without Tylenol, so big progress!
[2022-09-19 08:30:40] Omi Maurin: Great!  
Arnica might help for the pain and healing. 
😘😘
[2022-09-19 09:47:24] Grandpa Maurin: Very glad to hear that you are better, Teri. Relax and enjoy the day.
[2022-09-19 10:37:09] Omi Maurin: Tomorrow is Edna’s birthday. We, together with Teresa & Nelson, will pick her up at her residence at 1 pm and take her to East Side Mario’s un Stoufville for lunch. 
You are welcome to join us.
[2022-09-19 10:38:24] Omi Maurin: Thursday we will meet with Ulla and Raj for lunch at Jerusalem. 
Again, you are welcome to join us.
[2022-09-19 10:41:54] Rob Maurin: Thanks! Tentative yes for Tuesday, pending any doctor's appointments for Teri (still waiting for those details). 
And I'll see about Thursday, but Teri will not be able to join. (She's flying to Thunder Bay.)
[2022-09-19 11:17:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes have watched the proceedings in the background at the office. Certainly appreciating all of the ceremony and the amazing choirs. 
Gotta give them credit for such a huge organizational feat!
[2022-09-19 11:19:21] Omi Maurin: Yes, amazing!
I’m tired and sleepy from watching. I can’t imagine how exhausted the Royal family and guests must be.
[2022-09-23 09:00:23] Omi Maurin: Hi!
How is everyone doing today?
How is your thumb 👍 Teri?
[2022-09-23 09:48:52] Rob Maurin: Hi! I’m good.  Just made it up to the cottage.  I have my Paper Triangle friends coming up this weekend, but I’m here on my own for a day or so first.  

Teri is in Thunder Bay.  I think the finger is doing its thing slowly.  I’ll let Teri answer in more detail.
[2022-09-23 09:49:00] Rob Maurin: How are you?

‎[2022-09-23 10:31:57] Teri Smith: ‎image absente
[2022-09-23 11:06:12] Omi Maurin: Yes. We used to make it often, calling it “bavarois”. 
Or variations thereof, like grit Jello with whipped cream, or merengue.
[2022-09-24 10:14:19] Omi Maurin: Have you heard from Jeff, Teri?  Hoping that they are ok in PEI.  Fiona seems to have caused a lot of damage in PEI and rest of Maritimes.
How are you doing?
[2022-09-24 10:16:49] Teri Smith: They lost power last night (and still don’t have power), but don’t appear to have any damage. But last I heard they hadn’t ventured out yet, because it was still super windy, etc.
[2022-09-24 10:18:13] Omi Maurin: I think a hurricane is worse than an earthquake...
[2022-09-24 12:09:30] Mom Monica Maurin: Glad to hear you’re healing Teri!

I liked bavarois!!

[2022-09-26 08:28:23] Omi Maurin: How is everyone doing today?
Teri,  how are Jeff and family in PEI?
Have a good week everyone!!
[2022-09-26 12:35:14] Teri Smith: Jeff and family are doing ok. Still no power as far as we know. He went to Moncton yesterday with a neighbour so they could both buy chainsaws. They sold out on the island basically immediately after Home Depot opened, so they had to go to Moncton. No damage at their place, luckily, but I think they needed the chainsaws to cut up a huge tree that fell across the neighbour’s driveway. He said it was a beautiful day yesterday.
[2022-09-26 12:40:44] Omi Maurin: Woww; glad they are ok and didn't suffer any damage.
[2022-09-27 15:13:40] Omi Maurin: Hola!
How are all of you doing?
Teri, how is your hand? Is/was today your appointment with the plastic surgeon?
[2022-09-27 18:28:53] Teri Smith: My hand is doing okay. I got to see it on Sunday when I had my nurse friend in TBay change the dressing for me. The swelling is not totally gone, but it has definitely decreased. My appointment at the hand clinic is tomorrow morning.
[2022-09-27 18:29:51] Omi Maurin: Good luck tomorrow!
Good night 😴😘
[2022-09-28 06:44:33] Mom Monica Maurin: Good luck Teri!
[2022-09-28 06:47:39] Omi Maurin: Let us know how it goes.
[2022-09-28 07:46:29] Omi Maurin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib-aWyctbfQ
[2022-09-28 08:08:56] Teri Smith: Thanks! All done. They removed the stitches and my nail, but then had to put some stitches back in. I will go back soon to see a hand therapist.
[2022-09-28 08:09:58] Omi Maurin: Ouch!  Is the thumb in a cast now?
[2022-09-28 08:11:23] Teri Smith: Still in the same splint I had before. Apparently the hand therapist will give me a custom splint that’s smaller.
[2022-09-28 08:15:55] Grandpa Maurin: Glad to know you’re recovering , Teri, and wish you continued progress .
[2022-09-28 11:46:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Hang in there Teri. I’m glad you’re getting good help. I hope it’s not feeling too painful after all of that meddling this morning.
[2022-09-28 12:28:08] Omi Maurin: Do you think you will be well enough to have us all over at the cottage for Thankgiving?
Or would you prefer to postpone the cottage weekend and to spend Thanksgiving in town?
[2022-09-28 12:51:03] Teri Smith: Oh, we’ll be fine! Someone else have to help Rob with dishes because I won’t be able to, but that’s all. 😀
[2022-09-28 13:17:43] Omi Maurin: You have to assign us what to bring
[2022-09-28 16:15:18] Rob Maurin: Thanks. We'll do some planning

Rob and Teri, if you’re not up to this weekend for any reason please don’t feel badly about us all changing plans.  
Let me know. Xo
[2022-10-04 07:13:44] Grandpa Maurin: Teri and Rob, I have my doubts as well concerning the load that we are imposing on Teri since she is left handed and the injury is in her left thumb. As much as we all intend to help her out, the burden is on her. Think about it.
[2022-10-04 07:15:18] Teri Smith: We’ve been hosting people solidly for the past week. As long as you are willing to help out with food prep and clean-up, we’re good to go!
[2022-10-04 07:16:49] Grandpa Maurin: I heard you loud and clear, Teri.

[2022-10-04 08:01:27] Omi Maurin: My job search

1. My first job was working in an Orange Juice factory, but I got canned. Couldn't concentrate.


2. Then I worked in the woods as a Lumberjack, but just couldn't hack it, so they gave me the axe.

3. After that, I tried being a Tailor, but wasn't suited for it, mainly because it was a sew-sew job.

4. Next, I tried working in a Muffler Factory, but that was too exhausting.

5. Then, tried being a Chef - figured it would add a little spice to my life, but just didn't have the thyme.

6. Next, I attempted being a Deli Worker, but any way I sliced it .... I couldn't cut the mustard.

7. My best job was as a Musician, but eventually found I wasn't noteworthy.

8. I studied a long time to become a Doctor, but didn't have any patience.

9. Next, was a job in a Shoe Factory. Tried hard but just didn't fit in.

10. I became a Professional Fisherman, but discovered I couldn't live on my net income.

11. Managed to get a good job working for a pool maintenance company, but the work was just too draining.

12. So then I got a job in a Workout Center, but they said I wasn't fit for the job.

13. After many years of trying to find steady work, I finally got a job as a Historian - until I realized there was no future in it.

14. My last job was working in Starbucks, but had to quit because it was always the same old grind.

15. So, I tried retirement and I found that I'm perfect for the job!
[2022-10-04 08:54:13] Rob Maurin: Beautiful!
[2022-10-04 08:56:31] Rob Maurin: :-)

I tried opening an origami business, but it folded

[2022-10-04 11:29:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Springtime in paradise!!!
[2022-10-05 05:03:26] Omi Maurin: Change of plans ☹️
I'm slowly getting better with my back and leg, but Dad is gettig worse.  He is in a LOT of pain, even after pain killers, muscle relaxants and chiropractor visit yesterday. 
 We are sorry, but have to take a rain check for the Thanksgiving weekend at the cottage.
We are in no shape to be able to drive that long and wouldn't be fun to be there either.
We are very sorry;  we were looking forward to the weekend.
[2022-10-05 05:56:13] Mom Monica Maurin: Of course we can make other plans. Will
Give you a call later to brainstorm and see what works best.
[2022-10-05 09:39:20] Rob Maurin: We will make ourselves available for whatever, wherever. And I think Mom & Dad are equally flexible. So Monica, Aidan, let us know what works for you?
[2022-10-05 09:56:31] Grandpa Maurin: I have an appointment at the Pain Clinic tomorrow at 1 pm. Hopefully I will be injected to
minimize the spasms of my lower back.
[2022-10-05 09:57:13] Rob Maurin: Very good. Fingers crossed that it helps/
[2022-10-05 10:18:59] Omi Maurin: I can make "arroz con pollo"  in che crock pot for whenever it suits everyone.

[2022-10-06 08:42:09] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you. I’m better today! Going to go for a nice walk with Aidan this afternoon. Looking forward to that
[2022-10-06 12:56:10] Rob Maurin: Any further thoughts on when to do something for Thanksgiving?
[2022-10-06 13:31:14] Grandpa Maurin: I had six or so injections in my lower back of the same drug they use for epidurals. Vally had the same treatment  . Still we do not know feel any better  . Time will tell. Now it’s 💤 nap time.
[2022-10-06 13:33:05] Omi Maurin: We are flexible; discuss it amongst you.
[2022-10-06 14:40:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Rob and I just spoke - we propose this:
[2022-10-06 14:40:51] Mom Monica Maurin: We arrive at Omi and Grandpa's for dinner on Saturday -- 6 pm arrival time.
[2022-10-06 14:41:35] Mom Monica Maurin: We will bring: already-bbq'd meats; sweet potato side dish; gravy; a salad; some desserts; something to drink.

Therefore , unless you want something different, don’t bring any drinkables. Thanks for all the food but ,  please, remember we will be only six at the table.
[2022-10-06 16:00:27] Mom Monica Maurin: oh that's so funny. ok, i think we have drinks covered. thank you!
[2022-10-06 16:00:39] Mom Monica Maurin: and yes we will bring food for 6, not 60 :)

[2022-10-07 09:14:21] Rob Maurin: Yes! We took them to Thunder Bay last Christmas. Usually one direction has super cheap seats, and the other direction less cheap. And they charge you for every possible detail, including a carry-on bag. But if you're travelling light, it can definitely be cheaper than Air Canada.
[2022-10-07 09:14:51] Rob Maurin: We looked into them for visiting Mike and Moe in Arizona, but it turned out to be cheaper to fly Air Canada, when all the details were added up
[2022-10-07 09:16:11] Omi Maurin: It usually works out like that :(

I feel strange not preparing anything…
I’m being obedient and we haven’t prepared a thing!!!
[2022-10-08 14:10:23] Teri Smith: We’ve got it covered!
Do you have a salad spinner?
[2022-10-08 14:11:06] Omi Maurin: Thanks and yes 👍

[2022-10-13 06:22:53] Omi Maurin: How was your gig last night Rob?
[2022-10-13 06:24:42] Rob Maurin: It was fun, thanks! A good turnout, and a very receptive crowd I thought.
[2022-10-13 06:24:47] Rob Maurin: How are you guys?
[2022-10-13 06:26:07] Omi Maurin: We are fine, thanks.  Just surfacing;  no pool on Thursdays.
[2022-10-13 06:27:48] Omi Maurin: How is the new bandage holding up, Teri?  Could you get a better sleep?
[2022-10-13 06:50:01] Teri Smith: It didn’t make much of a difference for sleeping, but it’s very nice to have something so much smaller, and to be able to move my wrist.
[2022-10-13 08:48:15] Rob Maurin: The link for tickets to the December 6 show just went live, in case you're interested. 

I super appreciate your support (so much support! so many years!) but please don't feel an obligation to come to every show.

[2022-10-14 14:02:25] Omi Maurin: Nelba, Pablo’s mom, Roberto’s ex, will be in TO this coming week visiting her brother. 
We intend to have them over for coffee one day, whenever we can get together. 
Anyone interested to join us?
[2022-10-14 17:27:05] Rob Maurin: I very much would have liked it, but not sure it's going to work. We're up north for a few days (just got up, not returning until Wednesday night). I have meetings on Thursday, so Friday afternoon is probably my only chance? What days is Nelba around?
[2022-10-14 17:40:11] Omi Maurin: Not sure. I think the whole week. 
She didn’t know what her brother’s and sister-in-law’s schedule is, either. 
Will let you know. 
Have fun at the cottage!!
[2022-10-14 17:41:42] Rob Maurin: We could also do Saturday or Sunday (not this weekend, but next), in the early afternoon. We have dinner plans on the Saturday.

[2022-10-16 18:56:04] Rob Maurin: Wow
[2022-10-16 18:56:44] Rob Maurin: Unfortunately I actually have a work dinner on Thursday! (First time in… three years?)

Give her our best.
[2022-10-17 05:07:54] Mom Monica Maurin: I’m a maybe for Thursday. Another busy week so we will see. 
Have a lovely day everyone.
[2022-10-17 06:21:50] Grandpa Maurin: Do not worry if you cannot make it. We will save some bokchoi for you.
[2022-10-17 06:34:47] Grandpa Maurin: Or maybe some tripe fritters?
[2022-10-17 07:07:05] Rob Maurin: Bok choi fritters stuffed with tripe!

How did your work dinner go, Rob?
[2022-10-23 13:34:57] Teri Smith: Hey, Monica and Aidan - if you haven’t already voted and will be voting at St. John school tomorrow, keep you eyes open for a friendly ballot officer. 😀

[2022-10-23 16:31:25] Teri Smith: Yes, thank you. I’m very important.
[2022-10-23 16:32:36] Grandpa Maurin: I’m sure you are getting a car allowance.
[2022-10-23 16:36:17] Teri Smith: Car allowance, food allowance, clothing allowance. So many allowances. 😂
[2022-10-23 16:47:17] Grandpa Maurin: Way to go, Teri!!!
[2022-10-24 14:36:31] Omi Maurin: How are things going at the polling stations, Teri?
[2022-10-24 14:40:29] Teri Smith: Good! Pretty slow, generally, but little bursts of activity now and then.
[2022-10-24 14:42:17] Omi Maurin: It seemed ok where we went this morning. Not too busy, but a steady flow - mainly seniors 😉
[2022-10-24 14:51:01] Omi Maurin: How late do you have to stay?
[2022-10-24 14:57:22] Teri Smith: Yep, we were busy with seniors between 10 and 11. Polls close at 8:00, we’ll be here until about 9:00, I think.

[2022-10-31 09:00:42] Rob Maurin: Hi!
It was a rough night with lots of coughing.  (Sorry Teri!)
But I feel like it’s one of those S.O.B. coughs that will only bother me at night.  I feel pretty good now, though I’m just getting mobile so my lungs are still clearing out.
[2022-10-31 09:00:52] Rob Maurin: How are you?
[2022-10-31 09:09:28] Omi Maurin: Poooor baby!  Onion juice and honey for your cough🤣!
Still negative for Covid?
I hope you get well soon!!!
[2022-10-31 09:52:57] Rob Maurin: Yup.  Still negative.  And it’s a very typical cold for me.
[2022-10-31 09:53:06] Teri Smith: My thumb is good, thanks. No more splint as of Friday. Now the focus is on movement. I still can’t bend it much, but I’m doing my exercises, etc., so presumably that will come.

I am fine — spent the day painting. Tidying up now. 
Lots of love. Xo
[2022-11-05 14:37:22] Mom Monica Maurin: FYI - I just had a nice chat with kai. All is well in Vancouver :)
[2022-11-05 15:13:21] Grandpa Maurin: Good to hear you are well and doing something nice like painting. Over here, same as usual, I will be seeing the orthopaedic surgeon next Tuesday looking for some relief. Enjoy the last of the warm weather we are having.

The doc is here in Mississauga, not too far. 
Thanks
[2022-11-05 15:37:35] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom and Dad, I was thinking so much about when I used to watch you paint our rooms. Wow. That was so much work. I remember moments of those big redecorating projects like they were yesterday.  :) so nice. Thank you. 

And I was remembering going to the paint store in Thorncliffe to look at the books filled with wallpaper!!! What fun. I will never forget the lovely jobs you did in redoing our rooms when Rob and I were in Chile! I remember the little roses on the wallpaper. I loved that pattern.
[2022-11-05 15:38:06] Mom Monica Maurin: Hehe. Live-in lift. Good deal if you can get it!
[2022-11-05 15:39:00] Grandpa Maurin: No , the doc is some 10 minutes away and we can both drive. Walking is the problem but any activity sitting down 🪑 is a pleasure.
[2022-11-05 15:39:39] Mom Monica Maurin: I understand.

[2022-11-06 15:45:01] Mom Monica Maurin: Just heard from Kai -- he's ok....busy studying. 🙂
[2022-11-06 15:45:26] Omi Maurin: Great; thanks
[2022-11-07 05:22:09] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Yup as long as they have water and there lights turn on and off at the appropriate times they are fine :)
[2022-11-07 05:33:16] Rob Maurin: Better.  Still coughing at night but a little better every night.  I slept in my own bed last night, so that’s progress!
[2022-11-07 05:33:54] Rob Maurin: You have to be careful or they’ll stay up all night watching Netflix
[2022-11-07 06:16:56] Grandpa Maurin: Do not forget Buckley’ cough syrup, it is wonderful!
[2022-11-07 12:41:10] Mom Monica Maurin: Hope you’re feeling better soon, Rob. And I hope you’re getting mobility back, Teri. Thinking of you guys. 

Is anyone having trouble with their Rogers devices? Looks like our internet has been down for most of the day at home. ??

[2022-11-08 17:50:53] Mom Monica Maurin: great -- good for her
[2022-11-09 02:26:25] Mom Monica Maurin: Aidan and I are at our gate. We passed security and are getting settled in — considering Tim’s or Starbucks that blessedly are open near our gate. Have a good day everyone. We hope that Mom and Dad are feeling better today. 
Happy travels, Rob and Teri. Xxoo

PS - Kai finished his exams for this past block yesterday so he’s off until Monday! We look forward to seeing him soon. :)

[2022-11-09 08:03:21] Rob Maurin: How are you guys?
[2022-11-09 08:06:04] Omi Maurin: We are ok. Not much change from yesterday.

[2022-11-10 08:54:18] Omi Maurin: This is my favourite of the 2.
[2022-11-10 08:57:26] Grandpa Maurin: The hotel looks nice and the breakfast plentiful.
[2022-11-10 09:07:46] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thank you!
[2022-11-10 09:09:51] Omi Maurin: Nice picture of Aidan!
[2022-11-10 09:47:34] Rob Maurin: Good morning/afternoon! We're still drinking coffee at Mike's, trying to get organized for the day. 
We're experimenting with an "eSIM" service instead of paying roaming fees. It seems to be working for me, and not for Teri. In any event, I do NOT have phone service with this plan, so WhatsApp is almost certainly the best way to reach me for the next week. Teri currently has phone, but won't if we get her eSIM working too. 
If you need us by phone, try Mike: 309-532-1823
[2022-11-10 09:53:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Have fun!
[2022-11-11 08:44:13] Rob Maurin: Good morning! How is everyone?
[2022-11-11 08:44:26] Rob Maurin: We’re packing up now to head off to Sedona
[2022-11-11 08:46:39] Omi Maurin: Ok at this end of the world. 
Going to Sedona on your own?
When is Maureen returning to AZ?
[2022-11-11 09:53:36] Teri Smith: We’re driving to Sedona on our own, but Mike will follow later today. Maureen will return either tomorrow night or Sunday night, still tbd.
[2022-11-11 09:55:16] Omi Maurin: Have fun!  
Too bad that plans got altered by COVID. 
Stay healthy!!!
😘😘♥️
[2022-11-11 16:24:55] Mom Monica Maurin: We are good. It’s been a nice and busy day. Saw Dante for a long coffee and chat. Now Aidan and kai and I are at an authentic pizza place kai heard about. Very busy here!! Looking forward to our pizza. I hope you’re all well n
[2022-11-11 16:28:01] Grandpa Maurin: Great to hear you are all ok. Enjoy your pizza.
[2022-11-11 16:39:14] Rob Maurin: Made it to Sedona around lunch.  Ate, went for a short (but beautiful) hike.  Now at our AirBnB waiting for Mike.  All is good.

[2022-11-12 16:02:42] Grandpa Maurin: Hello Monica and Aidan! , do not chill too much that you freeze because they will have to de-ice you so that you can take off!!!!
Did you enjoy my nautical joke?.
[2022-11-12 16:26:21] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh very good joke!

[2022-11-14 09:48:30] Omi Maurin: A True Story .... Carnation Milk
When opening a can of carnation evaporated milk for your recipes just smile and think of this:
A little old lady from North Carolina had worked in and around her family’s dairy farm since she was old enough to walk, with hours of hard work and little compensation…
So when canned Carnation Milk became available in grocery stores, she read an advertisement offering $5000 for the best slogan/rhyme beginning with “Carnation milk is best of all ....”
She said to herself “ I know all about milking cows and dairy farms… I can do this!”
She sent in her entry, and about a week later, a black limo drove up in front of her house… A man got out and said, “Carnation LOVED your entry so much, we are here to award you $1000, even though we WILL NOT Be able to use it...
Here is her entry
😂😂😂
Carnation Milk
Is best of all, No tits to pull ,
No hay to haul,
No buckets to wash,
No shit to pitch ,
Just poke a hole
In the Son-********

[2022-11-15 15:46:06] Mom Monica Maurin: All of the pictures above were from our tour of UBC. Kai showed us around and it was so beautiful. Only the Granville one was not UBC — I bet you would never have recognized Dante! We barely did! :)
[2022-11-15 15:54:54] Omi Maurin: Great pictures !!!!  Thanks!!
[2022-11-15 16:01:03] Grandpa Maurin: Beautiful photos!. I do not remember Grandville Island.Dante is completely unknown to me.
[2022-11-15 16:02:13] Omi Maurin: No, we wouldn’t have recognized Dante. 
We probably wouldn’t recognize Sofia either.

[2022-11-23 13:57:06] Mom Monica Maurin: I am amazed that Christmas is only a few weeks away. What are we thinking of by way of celebrations? When and where suits you all? I don't recall if we already made plans - please forgive me - i'm happy with anything you all find comfy. Thanks!
[2022-11-23 14:15:33] Omi Maurin: Our land line (phone) doesn’t seem to be working.
If you are trying to call and can’t get through, call our cell phones. 
😘
[2022-11-23 14:26:53] Mom Monica Maurin: ah ok! That explains it! I called you twice 🙂 We will chat another time.
[2022-11-24 10:06:23] Rob Maurin: Did you ever get your phone fixed?
[2022-11-24 10:25:35] Omi Maurin: Yes, but we aren’t home.
[2022-11-24 14:08:37] Omi Maurin: We’ll gladly host Christmas Eve - with some help as usual.
[2022-11-25 06:37:03] Rob Maurin: That's fine with us if that's what you prefer! We can host, too, or go wherever.
[2022-11-25 06:37:08] Rob Maurin: Good morning everyone
[2022-11-28 04:50:59] Mom Monica Maurin: OK great -- then the 24th at mom and dad's -- what if we gather in the late afternoon so we can spend some time together and then have dinner? And are we doing presents or no or what do you all feel like doing? Honestly. :)
[2022-11-28 04:51:07] Mom Monica Maurin: I'm good either way. Whatever.
[2022-11-28 07:44:39] Omi Maurin: Will you be working on the 24th, Aidan? 🎄🎅

[2022-11-28 09:22:28] Mom Monica Maurin: If we want to do a secret santa we can draw names this way.....very cute....
[2022-11-28 09:22:30] Mom Monica Maurin: https://www.elfster.com/
[2022-11-28 09:23:11] Mom Monica Maurin: but I don't mean to say we should draw names or do gifts -- whatever everyone wants. I'm happy with no gifts or only gifts for people whose names start with M -- just to keep it simpler. whatever.
[2022-11-28 09:26:12] Omi Maurin: Yes, let’s draw names! 👍😘
[2022-11-28 09:43:06] Rob Maurin: Great!
[2022-11-28 09:59:52] Omi Maurin: We’ll make a ham and hash potato casserole, if you all want.
[2022-11-28 10:01:41] Rob Maurin: And/or I can make turkey…
[2022-11-28 10:03:00] Omi Maurin: Turkey sounds great 😊, but not too complicated to transport?
[2022-11-28 10:20:03] Mom Monica Maurin: OK -- here is the food list so far:
[2022-11-28 10:21:11] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom & Dad: Ham & hash potato casserole; Rob & Teri: Turkey; Monica/Aidan/Kai: Vegetarian Main (Nutloaf maybe), Salad, Side veggie, mushroom gravy, new york style cheesecake w berry compote
[2022-11-28 10:48:09] Omi Maurin: I would say either ham or Turkey. Both is too much. 
I vote for turkey 😊

[2022-11-29 04:56:47] Omi Maurin: Good morning!!
G&M have invited us to a 3 pm  Christmas show in Niagara, at the Casino.
We will be leaving here around 10:30 am and returning after dinner.
G&M  like to gamble;  we might "invest" $20.- in the slot machine and hope for the best 😉
I'm taking the walking stick and we know that there are plenty of spaces where we can sit down and rest our aching knees, backs, etc.
Have a nice day everyone!!!!
😘😘
[2022-11-29 04:57:18] Rob Maurin: Good for you! Have fun!

[2022-12-03 10:08:22] Omi Maurin: How is the wind in your area?  Very strong and eerie here!
[2022-12-03 13:33:50] Mom Monica Maurin: I didn't know how windy it was until I walked to the Big Carrot (2 mins) and found it very hard to do! A good day to stay indoors. Off to have a nap. xo
[2022-12-03 14:04:51] Rob Maurin: It was super windy on my drive back from up north.  But everything seems peaceful again at home

[2022-12-06 07:27:13] Rob Maurin: Thanks Mom and Dad and Monica for your respective eye histories.  
I just had my eye doc appointment (a regular checkup) and made sure she has all the details in her files so she can monitor as needed.  
As of right now, I’m just normal-old.  Small change to my reading prescription but nothing else needed.
[2022-12-06 07:29:01] Omi Maurin: Good to know!!  Thanks for the update!
Have a nice day!
[2022-12-06 07:29:18] Omi Maurin: Break a leg tonight!!

[2022-12-08 16:44:17] Rob Maurin: Thanks
[2022-12-08 16:44:44] Rob Maurin: We’re at the airport.  Flight is 2.5 hours delayed, but we have food and friends so it’s all good
[2022-12-08 16:45:51] Omi Maurin: What is your flight number?
Enjoy every minute!
[2022-12-08 16:48:50] Rob Maurin: AC 834
[2022-12-13 12:08:56] Omi Maurin: Are you still willing and able to make the scalloped potatoes, the sponge sauce and the turkey for Christmas Eve?
[2022-12-13 12:10:28] Omi Maurin: ‎Ce message a été supprimé.
[2022-12-13 12:12:17] Omi Maurin: Mo: still on with your offer?
[2022-12-13 12:12:56] Omi Maurin: We’ll arrange for whatever is left. Not too much - thanks!! 😘😘
[2022-12-13 12:18:34] Rob Maurin: Funny you should ask. At exactly this moment I am out shopping for the turkey. The short answer is, yes, we will bring that or the equivalent, if everybody is OK with a substitution. Apparently there’s a turkey shortage or some similar crisis, and the prices are astronomical. I’m trying to get a sense of just exactly what that means. But we will fill those gaps in the menu one way or the other.
[2022-12-13 12:19:45] Omi Maurin: Whatever you decide will be great!!
[2022-12-13 12:24:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes I will bring whatever I said earlier. I wrote it down somewhere. Mom and dad you should not over exert yourselves so maybe let us know what else you had in mind so we can help

A big belated thank you for all of the lovely birthday wishes and well wishes otherwise. I finished courses and exams two days ago, and have just been exploring around town, since. Looking forward to seeing everyone at the end of next week!

Thanks!!!!!!!
[2022-12-16 17:08:10] Mom Monica Maurin: Fantastic! So lovely your xmas video! Thanks, guys. Merry Christmas!
[2022-12-16 17:35:47] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey all -- I'm looking over my previous list of offerings re. food for the 24th and I can't get it all done. It's just an very busy week with work and work events and doctor visits and I don't yet know when or how I will get the roof fixed so that has me housebound so far. So I will change it so that I am bringing: Green salad; broccoli as a side dish; and maybe a vegetarian main but I'm fine without it and you're all having turkey so I think that we are ok without the vegetarian main. Since teri is making bread pudding (which I'm very happy about!) I won't make a cheesecake. Is that all ok with all of you?
[2022-12-16 18:11:09] Omi Maurin: Sure! Don’t worry!!!
[2022-12-16 18:44:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks. Night night.

[2022-12-20 09:39:42] Grandpa Maurin: He will get here sooner or later.  This is problem that you always encounter when travelling in winter.
[2022-12-20 09:41:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Yeah - he says he is fine.  All will be well. :)

[2022-12-20 13:19:43] Mom Monica Maurin: A few minutes ago kai said they were about ready to board. The flight aware now no longer says they are waiting to depart. I guess that means they have taken off successfully
[2022-12-20 13:20:18] Mom Monica Maurin: Because flight aware says "13:15 pm PST on time" and it's past that time now
[2022-12-20 13:22:30] Mom Monica Maurin: He just said he's still boarding
[2022-12-20 13:32:04] Omi Maurin: Great 👍!!!!

[2022-12-22 14:08:02] Rob Maurin: We're good. All set for Christmas as long as the roads to Mississauga are passable

I wouldn’t want either one of you to travel in bad weather. 
😘🙏
[2022-12-22 14:55:01] Rob Maurin: Ditto!
[2022-12-23 06:52:48] Omi Maurin: The strong wind and snow has started in Mississauga ☹️🥶
Stay home, keep warm!
😘
[2022-12-23 10:52:55] Rob Maurin: It’s snowing lightly here.  It was windy around 10:00 here too, but that seems diminished, at least on our small street
[2022-12-23 10:55:49] Omi Maurin: Here it's still quite wind and light snow.
[2022-12-23 15:16:34] Teri Smith: Hey, everyone. What time are we getting together tomorrow?
[2022-12-23 15:18:55] Omi Maurin: Whenever you decide, but if things continue with the weather, perhaps we should postpone the get-together. 
We don’t want you guys to be driving. 
😘
[2022-12-23 15:19:31] Teri Smith: The current forecast shows snow ending by 8:00am. Roads should be clear after that.
[2022-12-23 15:33:28] Teri Smith: Let me ask it this way: in your ideal world, what time would we arrive? 😀
[2022-12-23 15:35:48] Omi Maurin: In an ideal world we are happy whenever it’s convenient for you. 
Discuss it with Monica and the boys.
[2022-12-23 18:49:43] Rob Maurin: @14169067363 what do you and the guys think? We’re pretty flexible
[2022-12-24 06:26:34] Rob Maurin: How about 5:00 arrival? Does that work for everyone?
[2022-12-24 06:47:29] Omi Maurin: It works for us!
[2022-12-24 06:48:17] Grandpa Maurin: Any time works for us!
[2022-12-24 09:41:21] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok we will aim for 5 as well!

[2022-12-28 08:12:10] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning all. How is Rob? Did you get up to the cottage? How’s the snow?
[2022-12-28 08:24:00] Rob Maurin: Thanks for asking, Monica.  
Cough is not great. We're delaying our trip north for another day so I can see my doctor (tomorrow morning). 
So we haven’t seen the snow but by all accounts it’s incredibly deep!
[2022-12-28 09:40:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes - that's what I'm hearing from Shira who lives about half way up to your cottage -- she is busy shovelling her roof. Good luck with the doctor.
[2022-12-28 10:18:53] Rob Maurin: Thanks!
[2022-12-28 10:19:24] Rob Maurin: Dave and Justin have been snowed in at their place since before Christmas. And someone in Magnetawan said they got another foot of snow last night
[2022-12-28 10:20:54] Omi Maurin: Do you know if your driveway has been plowed?

[2022-12-28 10:42:27] Teri Smith: He’s going to do it today.
[2022-12-28 13:28:09] Rob Maurin: For some year-end Paper Triangle social media stuff, we want to post pictures of the people who have come to the shows (as opposed to just pictures of ourselves). Do any of you have  pictures of yourselves or the people you saw the show with, that you could share with me?
[2022-12-28 13:37:46] Mom Monica Maurin: I do not -- i intentionally tried not to get others in shots -- maybe next time??

[2022-12-30 06:35:48] Omi Maurin: How is everyone feeling this morning?  I hope we all got rid of sniffles and coughs.
Have a nice day!!
[2022-12-30 07:41:44] Grandpa Maurin: For two days I have awakened with the following beautiful and memorable song 🎵 in my mind:
https://youtu.be/z15pxWUXvLY
[2022-12-30 10:07:15] Rob Maurin: Ha! any idea why?
[2022-12-30 10:18:44] Mom Monica Maurin: That is so very beautiful dad!! Tear jerker but did my heart good. How beautiful. Rob, it’s a song for your next gig.
[2022-12-30 12:46:49] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, I have no explanation why I woke up twice with Puff in my mind. I do watch veterinarian shows that deal with domestic and farm animals and the wild animals of the Yukon and Alaska. The only dragon that I have ever seen is a dragonfly!!!
Monique, I remember the song being played on the radio , it was a big hit. I only know the first verse. I told Mom about my waking up with this song in my mind while we were having breakfast and she looked it up in Google.
I had no dreams that I could remember and find the connection. Most likely, I will never know.
[2022-12-30 13:09:05] Mom Monica Maurin: I’m so glad you shared it. It’s had me playing old songs all day. Here is one I know you will know….
[2022-12-30 13:09:11] Mom Monica Maurin: https://youtu.be/Dyl4x-CtpTY
[2022-12-30 13:58:20] Grandpa Maurin: Yes, I remember it well. Great voice and exceptionally clear pronunciation of the words.
On the subject of old music, Ian Tyson  passed away yesterday. “Ian and Sylvia’ sang Canadian country music, great duo.
[2022-12-30 14:08:54] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes, her voice is magnificent. It really stood out today, even among other beautiful songs. I didn't realize Ian Tyson and Sylvia were Canadian....rip.
[2022-12-31 08:08:00] Omi Maurin: Good morning !
How is everyone doing in Magnetawan and on Kingston Rd?
[2022-12-31 08:08:15] Omi Maurin: All ok in Mississauga 👍😘
[2022-12-31 09:42:42] Teri Smith: All good in Magnetawan. Rob is doing much better, and my symptoms are minor and seem to have plateaued, so no issues there.
[2022-12-31 10:04:16] Grandpa Maurin: Glad to hear that Rob is recovering and that you Teri, are not getting worse. Vally has some coughing spells and I cough occasionally to keep the family tradition . Vally just took the Covid test and it shows negative. Have a  great celebration tonight, I am sending you a truckload of 🍻 cheers 🥂.

[2023-01-01 08:34:32] Rob Maurin: Happy New Year everyone!
We just finished feeding our guests.  Now a walk so we can earn our next meal
[2023-01-01 08:34:49] Mom Monica Maurin: These fireworks were absolutely spectacular! And we learned that that view is a direct line to Harbourfront. I’m guess somewhere right in front of the islands. The display was half an hour long and easily the most elaborate and amazing display I’ve ever seen. Apparently, they are known as “high altitude fireworks”!
[2023-01-01 08:35:16] Mom Monica Maurin: Happy new year all. Have a nice walk dude. We will have a walk soon too. Just been taking it easy so far. Xo
[2023-01-01 08:35:52] Rob Maurin: Awesome.  Can’t see the video yet — cell signal is very weak.  I’ll have to watch when we get home.
[2023-01-01 08:36:41] Mom Monica Maurin: Aidan took just a minute of it. It got even more spectacular later on. Still
Amazes me.
[2023-01-01 08:40:39] Grandpa Maurin: Great video, Aidan. Those are the only fireworks we have seen. We saw nothing from  G&M’s apartment.
[2023-01-01 08:46:45] Grandpa Maurin: Happy New Year all ! Enjoy this warm day!.
[2023-01-03 06:28:13] Teri Smith: Hi everyone. Alfonsito’s birthday is coming - do we have plans to celebrate the occasion?
[2023-01-03 06:29:49] Teri Smith: We’ll be in Thunder Bay the weekend after the birthday for Tracie’s 50th. How about dinner in Mississauga on Sunday the 8th?
[2023-01-03 07:04:12] Grandpa Maurin: Sunday the 8th , any time , is fine with us. Thanks.
[2023-01-03 09:02:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Sunday 8 works for me provided I’m over the flu
[2023-01-03 09:46:05] Grandpa Maurin: Dr Ammad has officially determined that Vally‘s and my respiratory system have been compromised by a foreign agent. We have been prescribed antibiotics and we are waiting for them at the druggist.
[2023-01-03 10:28:37] Omi Maurin: Let’s hope so!!! 🙏😘👍
[2023-01-03 11:00:48] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok thanks for the update. Xo
[2023-01-03 11:50:37] Teri Smith: Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Hopefully the antibiotics kick in quickly.
[2023-01-03 12:59:44] Rob Maurin: You’re sick too! Crap.  I’m so sorry if I was the one who spread it around.  I thought it was just a tickle…
[2023-01-03 13:00:11] Rob Maurin: I’m glad you got the meds.

[2023-01-04 18:26:18] Omi Maurin: We are a bit better. Coughing a bit less.
[2023-01-04 18:27:11] Omi Maurin: Get / stay well everybody!!

[2023-01-05 08:15:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Still sick here. Called in sick again to work this one’s a doozy. Hoping to be better soon.
[2023-01-05 18:33:01] Omi Maurin: 🍁Canada Jr Hockey Gold Medal in Halifax 🇨🇦 !!! Yayyy
[2023-01-05 19:49:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Awesome!
[2023-01-07 08:35:02] Rob Maurin: How’s everyone?
[2023-01-07 09:24:53] Omi Maurin: Like yesterday. Not much improvement 😟
[2023-01-07 12:59:44] Grandpa Maurin: I am coughing still. I finished my antibiotics this morning. Going back to our doctor‘s office next Monday. Have you and Teri recovered fully?.
[2023-01-07 13:06:58] Rob Maurin: Not quite.  I think we’re both better.  I’m almost done, I think.  Teri is still coughing a bit.
[2023-01-07 14:36:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Glad to hear you’re getting better r and t. 
Today I went on my first walk in over a week. Nice to get out. Coughing is much better. All around best day so far. 
Shall we shoot for next Sunday for dad’s birthday - of course still monitoring for mom and dad to be all better as well?
[2023-01-07 14:38:00] Teri Smith: Glad to hear you’re on the mend. We’ll still be in Thunder Bay next weekend (returning Monday the 16th.)
[2023-01-07 14:39:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh ok.
[2023-01-07 16:32:25] Grandpa Maurin: Please forget about celebrating my birthday!!!!!

[2023-01-17 07:40:04] Omi Maurin: 😢
[2023-01-17 08:30:46] Kai Maurin-Jones: Yup, we had lots of rain during the day and overnight Sunday, so I woke up to some bubbling and drops in spots of the ceiling in the bathroom. I messaged my landlord about it and he did something to temporarily fix it (this isn't the first time this has happened), but they definitely need to do some real repairs on it. All good for me temporarily, again, though
[2023-01-17 08:38:55] Kai Maurin-Jones: Also since I'm in my Semantic Analysis class right now - which is all about trying to minimize linguistic ambiguity  and the prof was just using this as an example, I'll share this with you all: "Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana."
[2023-01-17 08:46:40] Omi Maurin: Glad that things are ok for you, at least temporarily. 
Have a nice (and dry) day!

[2023-01-24 12:21:11] Grandpa Maurin: Hi everyone!, Just got back.  Stopped for lunch on our way home.
Not too much new to report.  This was like an "interim" consultation to make sure that I want surgery.  This therapist or whatever her title is, explained to us that I wil have a knee replacement . I will stay 1 night in the hospital . The recovery therapy starts immediately and lasts for six weeks during which I will attend 2 physio sessions each week. Now we have to wait for a call from Dr. Cheah's office for an appointment with him for consultation and to set a date for surgery.
The waiting time for the operation is from 3 to 6 months .
So, that’s all folks.
[2023-01-24 12:22:27] Rob Maurin: Thanks for the update Dad. How do you feel about things? Is this what you were expecting?
[2023-01-24 13:07:55] Grandpa Maurin: We had assumed that we were going to meet Dr. Cheah but it was not so. The call came from the Knee Clinic which in fact is called Hip & 
Knee Rapid Access Clinic. This clinic assesses surgical candidates and this is what I was there for, to be assessed if I qualified for an operation. I am glad that

We received a phone call from the surgeon’s office and I was given an appointment with him on Thursday, February 9th.
I’m happy that the process is moving .

[2023-01-26 06:55:02] Rob Maurin: Thanks! We’re good.  Snowmaggeddon wasn’t a thing for us
[2023-01-26 06:56:23] Omi Maurin: We are fine as well. 
Appointment at the Pain clinic at 2 pm, but by then roads will have been cleaned.

[2023-01-27 07:52:21] Grandpa Maurin: Well, that was a smart remark! Did you have some clown broth for breakfast?.
[2023-01-27 11:15:57] Mom Monica Maurin: clown's broth - made of vegan clowns, yes
[2023-01-27 11:16:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Did everyone see my message about Feb 4?
[2023-01-27 11:30:57] Rob Maurin: That sounds great.  Dinner?
[2023-01-27 11:43:04] Grandpa Maurin: February 4th is perfect, dinner is perfect too. Gerd and Emmy will come over for dinner on Friday 3rd, stay in the Guest Suite of Park Mansion and will likely have breakfast with us on Saturday morning before they go back to Kitchener.
Look forward to seeing you all.
[2023-01-27 11:53:51] Mom Monica Maurin: OK Super.

[2023-01-31 08:41:02] Rob Maurin: Har har
[2023-02-01 07:50:48] Omi Maurin: Hello everybody!
How are all of you today?
We’ve been thinking about our get- together on Saturday and I believe that a late “once” will be the easiest.   Not much prep, not time sensitive and more relaxed than a formal meal. 
Does that work for all?
‎[2023-02-01 07:55:50] Grandpa Maurin: ‎image absente
[2023-02-01 09:23:02] Rob Maurin: I can't make it until about 6. So does that spoil the idea of "once"?
[2023-02-01 09:24:16] Omi Maurin: We can’t make it before 6:30 ish either.
[2023-02-01 13:06:55] Mom Monica Maurin: Sounds great. Thanks mom! What can we bring?
[2023-02-01 13:13:15] Omi Maurin: 👍. A cake perhaps?
We’ll have breads with all the fixings. 
Looking forward to seeing all of you!! 
Perhaps we can FaceTime or Zoom a bit with Kai?
😘👍
[2023-02-01 13:23:28] Teri Smith: I’m happy to bring a cake, unless you’d like to do that, Monica.
[2023-02-01 15:09:04] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok teri. You bring the cake. I will think on anything else.

Bundle up!!!!!!!!
😘🤗
[2023-02-02 16:09:08] Mom Monica Maurin: You bet! No plans to leave our house, luckily!
[2023-02-02 16:13:11] Omi Maurin: How about Aidan?
[2023-02-03 06:55:09] Aidan Maurin-Jones: I am at work 🤣 🤷‍♂️
[2023-02-03 07:28:57] Omi Maurin: Everything ok?  Was it very cold?
Thanks for letting us know 
Have a great day 😘

[2023-02-03 12:03:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Everyone's doing fine today? I'm so grateful that we all have warm homes to sleep in tonight. We are very lucky. Have a lovely day.
[2023-02-03 12:22:07] Omi Maurin: You are so right!!!  The sun is shining into our apartment, so much so that we have to close the blinds so that it doesn't get too ward.  Without the heating on, we have 24.5 degrees inside.  Dad is wearing shorts.
[2023-02-03 12:22:09] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Cold but it was fine
[2023-02-03 12:23:05] Omi Maurin: too warm - stupid spellcheck
[2023-02-03 12:26:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Dad and his shorts....in -20. Amazing
[2023-02-03 12:33:59] Grandpa Maurin: With the blinds open it reaches 26.5, with the blinds closed it is 24.5. Perfect weather for shorts and no
shirt!
[2023-02-03 12:46:34] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh my! You are bringing spring in sooner than Wiarton Willie
[2023-02-03 14:21:21] Rob Maurin: Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.  
What time?
[2023-02-03 14:22:54] Omi Maurin: 6:30 ish?

[2023-02-06 05:59:29] Mom Monica Maurin: Haha. Very good jokes!
[2023-02-06 06:00:27] Mom Monica Maurin: So…all we can hear is chainsaws and helicopters. They have almost cut down every single tree in moss park which is right beside us. Just piles of trees everywhere. Horrible.
[2023-02-06 06:02:35] Mom Monica Maurin: They were going to do that at the law society but the lawyers quickly got an injunction on the weekend. So now the loggers have gone double time cutting here before the court stops them.
[2023-02-06 06:02:38] Mom Monica Maurin: :(
[2023-02-06 06:02:55] Mom Monica Maurin: Fellow humans are sometimes so stupid
[2023-02-06 08:03:36] Mom Monica Maurin: Last man standing…. They’ve almost successfully gotten rid of all of them. And they are taking away the evidence as fast as they can. The helicopters have even stopped flying overhead.
‎[2023-02-06 08:03:48] Mom Monica Maurin: ‎image absente
[2023-02-06 08:04:20] Mom Monica Maurin: That big crane has a chainsaw on the end of it. It cuts and also there is an arm that just rips out stuff
[2023-02-06 08:04:49] Rob Maurin: No kidding.  What for?
[2023-02-06 08:15:30] Omi Maurin: Why??????
[2023-02-06 08:31:13] Grandpa Maurin: Are they preventing forest fires?. Idiots !!!. Are they widening the street?. It is perfect if they cut off branches that rest on the electric cables to prevent blackouts. Perhaps they will replace the trees with petunias.
[2023-02-06 08:31:33] Teri Smith: It’s for the new transit line.

[2023-02-06 09:02:43] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes - for the new subway. Unfortunately, there are other ways to put in the subway that don’t require the removal of 60 100-year old trees. The street is now bare. It’s really gross to see. Tons of workers making quick work of it before the court can hear anything and order an injunction. The community couldn’t rally fast enough. It started on Saturday morning without warning. So sad to see this
[2023-02-06 15:00:25] Kai Maurin-Jones: Hey all! Just to follow up on what I mentioned on Saturday - I'll be back from Feb 19-Feb 25, so I was hoping we could all get together on Family Day, if that works for everyone. Not picky about where or when, but it would be nice to see everyone 😊
[2023-02-06 15:02:36] Omi Maurin: Great Kai! Looking forward to a get-together.  Afternoon tea worked great for us for Grandpa's bday.  We could try it again, if it works for everybody.
[2023-02-06 15:03:19] Omi Maurin: How did your tests go today, Kai?
[2023-02-06 15:15:54] Mom Monica Maurin: Great!
[2023-02-06 17:49:40] Rob Maurin: We’re in! Thanks for making time for us, Kai

[2023-02-06 21:56:53] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thank you all! Looking forward to seeing everyone.
[2023-02-06 21:57:33] Kai Maurin-Jones: I think they went well, but we'll find out hopefully in the next week or so. Two more tomorrow and then I'm onto my next block of courses next week
[2023-02-06 22:00:32] Grandpa Maurin: We will be happy to see you again , Kai. Good luck in your tests!. Good night!

Now checking the “fine print” with a lawyer before accepting it. 
Closing in about 90 days.
[2023-02-11 10:13:30] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh my goodness! I am out right now and can’t yet chat. I will call you later. Wow! I’m sure this is filled with so much….
It’s good news and hard news…having been through something similar :)

[2023-02-12 09:08:42] Rob Maurin: Can you push the closing back so dad has more time to recover?
[2023-02-12 09:12:57] Omi Maurin: A new offer. 
We hope that 90 days plus should be ok. 
Dad sent the docs to our (Nelsons’ friend ) the lawyer for his comments.

Who is going to be in the Super Bowl halftime show 2023?
What time is the halftime show?
What time does the Super Bowl halftime show start? The halftime performance usually takes place about an hour-and-a-half into the game, which means that fans can expect to see Rihanna take the stage somewhere around 7:45-8 p.m. E

[2023-02-16 10:16:15] Rob Maurin: Mom & Dad, what's the word on the condo sale? Any opinions from your lawyer friend?
[2023-02-16 10:35:27] Grandpa Maurin: ‎Ce message a été supprimé.
[2023-02-16 10:47:40] Grandpa Maurin: Raul suggested some change s to the text of the offer and we passed them on to our real estate contact, Sabine. Next we had a zoom conference with Sabine and her boss-owner of the R E company. Our changes were discussed and the text will be changed and passed on to purchaser for approval.  We have accepted the price offered, UF 6,250. In essence the apartment is sold but the revised offer has to signed by the purchaser first and then by us . This first step is expected to be concluded next week.
[2023-02-16 10:49:13] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, how did your show go last night?
[2023-02-16 10:49:59] Rob Maurin: Wow. Great! Good luck with the final details. What's the closing date?
[2023-02-16 10:50:38] Rob Maurin: It was super fun. The audience was great, very participatory and vocal, and the energy was really good. I wish every show was like that.
[2023-02-16 10:51:54] Omi Maurin: Great!  Congrats!!  Sorry we weren't there.
[2023-02-16 10:54:34] Grandpa Maurin: It cannot be determined yet. We told them that we expect to vacate the apartment in first half of May.
[2023-02-16 10:56:51] Grandpa Maurin: Glad to know your show was great. We regret to have missed being with you both nights.
[2023-02-16 11:51:24] Grandpa Maurin: Regarding our family get together on the 20th. Never mind my nap time, I have skipped it several times already, “times are a-changing “ says the 🎵 song !. So, come when it suits all, whether it is 1, 2,3,4,5 or 6. We will have 🥯 bread 🥖 and stuff. We are conscious that Tuesday 21st is a work day so you should be able to go to your respective homes early enough to have a restful night and wake up full of energy the next morning . 
Therefore, let us know your ETA so that we can program the working hours of the. Cleaning crew.

[2023-02-21 08:11:20] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
Kai, I have a question regarding your "Wordle app".
For example today,  I could have had the solution in one try, but I matched the letter they wanted only on the 5th try.  How does the app know what option is the right one?
I guess that perhaps I'm asking for an answer I might not even understand...🤣
Have a nice day everyone 😘

[2023-02-22 10:00:55] Rob Maurin: Hee hee!
[2023-02-22 10:52:07] Mom Monica Maurin: Hehe.  These always make me laugh. A good batch you’ve got there, dad.
[2023-02-22 20:54:17] Kai Maurin-Jones: 😂😂 so....to some degree, it doesn't! Today, I've added an option to include a "bias" when guessing the next word. Basically, it chooses the word which has the highest "entropy", which, in this context, means the word that has the strongest impact on the size of next possible guesses. This means that a word with the highest entropy will be able to make this list of next possible guesses, smaller than any other possible word in this point in the game. I'll send another message with an example to explain better!

All appointments at the hospital (Trillium Health Partners  - 150 Sherway Dr., Etobicoke).
March 13  (take list of meds and health card)
2:15 pm blood work  
3:00 pm appointment with a nurse
3:30 pm appointment with a doctor  (not Dr. Cheah)
March 21
10:30 am  appointment with anesthesiologist  (go to patient registration
when finished stop at x-ray department for x-ray for surgery
They have Dr. Cheah's requisition on file
March 28
6:00 am arrive at hospital (fasting from midnight)
8:00 am surgery
I guess we'll find out details re visiting hours on the 28th and discharge on the 29th when he registers.

[2023-03-04 06:54:33] Mom Monica Maurin: As you can see, the snow plows and salt trucks have been going several times last night on our street. That’s very helpful.
[2023-03-04 06:55:28] Teri Smith: We just shoveled and the snow is SUPER heavy. It’s very pretty, though!

[2023-03-04 10:15:19] Mom Monica Maurin: Skylights seems good so far. Fingers crossed. A lot of melting snow out there. Very good
[2023-03-04 10:16:15] Omi Maurin: The one standing next to Herbert is Sabine, the agent. The other couple, the purchaser.

[2023-03-06 07:46:22] Omi Maurin: But Alejandro, the contractor,  has mentioned a few times " hay que cambiar la carpeta" .  🤣
[2023-03-06 07:48:04] Omi Maurin: Carpeta is spanglish for carpet.  Not correct!!!

[2023-03-06 09:31:02] Kai Maurin-Jones: Morning, everyone!

Over the weekend, I competed in something called a 'hackathon'. Contrary to how it sounds, it doesn't actually have anything to do with hacking anything or anyone, but rather is just a very short window of time to start and complete a given project. Today is the last day of the hackathon, and the winner is determined by popular vote. Anyone can vote, even people outside the competition. Our team is called 2hack2furious and we’ve made a web app that can take in a .CSV file, do basic cleaning of the data, and then evaluate and anonymize sensitive data within the file according to certain user feedback. Feel free to test it out (no inputted data is stored anywhere or kept track of)!

Here's a link where you can vote for us and all you need to vote is an email address. Feel free to use a burner email. Voting must be done by 4pm PST. Thank you in advance!

[2023-03-06 09:43:16] Kai Maurin-Jones: Thanks!

[2023-03-07 09:29:57] Kai Maurin-Jones: hey everyone! I was exhausted yesterday after things wrapped up, so thanks for your patience. The hackathon went great and we did in fact take home the "Viewer's Choice Award". I think we ended up with something 64% of ALL votes, out of all 3 teams 😅 so thank you for your support! We quite literally couldn't have done it without you 😊. I also wrote a linkedin post about my experience.

[2023-03-08 10:35:17] Omi Maurin: We are off to Oakville for my appointment with the rheumatologist.  The appointment booked in. November was for March 29, but I could change it for today. 
Wish me luck!!
[2023-03-08 10:36:51] Rob Maurin: Oh, great! Good luck!
[2023-03-08 10:36:55] Omi Maurin: We leave 2 “maestros” tiling the bathroom….  According to the main contractor there won’t be a problem 🙏
[2023-03-08 12:50:50] Mom Monica Maurin: Good stuff. Let us know how things went at the doc’s. Xo
[2023-03-08 13:45:39] Omi Maurin: We just got back.  The guys are still working, but not for long, as the building doesn't allow work to be done past 5 pm.
[2023-03-08 13:50:25] Omi Maurin: Very disappointed about my doctor's visit.
He gave me a new med for the rheumatoid arthritis, Metoject, a subcutaneous injection, as well as folic acid.
He says he can't do anything about my back pain and also nothing for my weak and painful leg.
For that he gave me a different pain killer: Pregabalin.
[2023-03-08 13:51:01] Omi Maurin: I have to study the literature he gave me and see what to do next...
[2023-03-08 14:43:11] Omi Maurin: On a lighter note:
[2023-03-08 14:43:17] Rob Maurin: Aw, I’m sorry there isn’t a clear solution.  Hopefully the Metoject and Pregabalin help

[2023-03-09 05:50:09] Rob Maurin: No party?!
[2023-03-09 05:55:20] Mom Monica Maurin: Good joke. I wish I could remember them all. Maybe Aidan can keep a log?
[2023-03-09 05:55:32] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks for the Tio Nelson details
[2023-03-09 06:49:47] Grandpa Maurin: No party. We and 2 other couples were invited to have dinner with N& T. We declined because of our mobility problems.
[2023-03-09 06:59:09] Omi Maurin: They are flying on March 16 to Paris and then to Barcelona to celebrate both birthdays.  
Teresa's is on the 19th of March.
[2023-03-10 07:17:34] Grandpa Maurin: I’m with Mom in Emergency, only one visitor. She was checked by one doctor who believes it could be arthritis in her hip. She is going to have an X-ray taken. I will be going home with George in a while.
[2023-03-10 07:18:43] Rob Maurin: Thanks for the update.  We’ll be heading your way in a bit and you can let us know whether to meet you at home or at the hospital
[2023-03-10 07:33:35] Grandpa Maurin: Parking at the Hospital is almost non existent. I’m going home now and we can discuss the logistics there, in the apartment.
[2023-03-10 07:34:00] Rob Maurin: Ok, thanks.  See you soon
[2023-03-10 08:20:53] Rob Maurin: We’re en route. We’ll head to the condo unless you indicate otherwise
[2023-03-10 08:30:31] Mom Monica Maurin: I am with mom in emerg. She just came from X-rays. We are ok.
[2023-03-10 09:07:09] Grandpa Maurin: Aidan and I are in the apartment. If you wish to try your luck at the hospital parking garage , go ahead .
[2023-03-10 09:07:49] Teri Smith: But only one visitor allowed, right?
[2023-03-10 09:08:25] Teri Smith: We’re just a few minutes away from the condo, so we’ll come there first.
[2023-03-10 09:08:43] Grandpa Maurin: Okay
[2023-03-10 09:26:27] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom got morphine and muscle relaxants. She’s still in a lot of pain but hopefully the meds will kick in soon. She is starting to feel a bit groggy. 
We chatted with the emerg doctor who is very nice - and he said the X-ray of mom’s hip looks fine. No arthritis. 
He will ask a nurse practitioner who specializes in geriatrics to come to help us figure out how to manage mom going home. The doc will also put in a referral to an orthopaedic surgeon to have another look at mom’s hip in the future.
[2023-03-10 09:27:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Now we wait to get the pain managed and then see the nurse practitioner and physio who will help us figure out how to help her get mobile.
[2023-03-10 09:43:09] Rob Maurin: Thanks. We’re here with dad
[2023-03-10 09:43:32] Rob Maurin: Do you want help? We can come relieve you or assist
[2023-03-10 09:52:36] Mom Monica Maurin: No thanks. They said they will only allow one person here at a time. 
Mom is marginally more relaxed. Otherwise no change.
[2023-03-10 09:53:59] Rob Maurin: Ok.  Thanks.  We’ll await your next update.  
And if mom isn’t released in the next couple of hours, I’ll come and relieve you
[2023-03-10 09:55:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. Great. We will keep in touch
[2023-03-10 11:43:56] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom and I have been talking with lots of professionals here and they are making some determinations. Still trying to get the pain down more. In a few minutes I hope to go to Tim’s to get us some food and then I will call you while I’m in the lineup. :)
Is that ok?
[2023-03-10 13:23:22] Mom Monica Maurin: The doctor just said that he is going to order a CT scan now because he is baffled as to why mom’s leg isn’t working well. So we will continue here in emerg, wait for the CT scan and then the results. And perhaps then try walking again and see if she can go home after that. Will let you know when we get to the next stage in the process.
[2023-03-10 13:45:26] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for your report, Monique
[2023-03-10 13:48:50] Mom Monica Maurin: CT scan in progress right now :)
[2023-03-10 13:53:45] Mom Monica Maurin: Xo
[2023-03-10 13:53:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom looks much calmer
[2023-03-10 13:54:03] Mom Monica Maurin: And the doctors and staff are all great
[2023-03-10 13:54:38] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Excellent!!
[2023-03-10 13:56:25] Grandpa Maurin: Great. I hope they find the problem soon.
[2023-03-10 14:22:11] Mom Monica Maurin: Hello. Mom finished the CT scan. Didnt feel great doing it but it got done. She is certainly in better strength and spirits. She went to the bathroom with the help of a nice nurse. We just got her some water as well.
[2023-03-10 14:22:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Doing ok :)
[2023-03-10 14:39:14] Rob Maurin: Thanks
[2023-03-10 14:39:39] Rob Maurin: Sorry I missed your call.  We were chatting here and I accidentally turned my ringer off
[2023-03-10 14:39:54] Rob Maurin: Let me know if you want to tag out
[2023-03-10 14:52:47] Mom Monica Maurin: We are ok.
[2023-03-10 14:53:07] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom wants to know what kind of cake George brought up today :)

[2023-03-10 14:55:43] Rob Maurin: Might be!
[2023-03-10 14:56:28] Rob Maurin: No label, but it looks like it
[2023-03-10 14:56:46] Rob Maurin: George had already confessed that he had no clue :-)
[2023-03-10 15:00:39] Mom Monica Maurin: Haha!!
[2023-03-10 15:01:38] Grandpa Maurin: The plan I suggest is that Rob, Teri and Aidan go to the hospital, then you and Aidan leave. Rob and Teri stay with Mom for a while and leave and George and I do the last visitation.
[2023-03-10 15:03:01] Mom Monica Maurin: Let’s consider that in a while. For now we are really hoping to hear results soon and then know if mom is coming home now or not. 
So let’s consider that the next step once we know more. Ok?
Is there anything you need dad?
[2023-03-10 15:05:54] Grandpa Maurin: Okay we will wait to hear what the doctor says
[2023-03-10 15:07:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok
[2023-03-10 16:00:28] Mom Monica Maurin: I am watching out for a doctor to get some news for us. Nothing much happening here. Mom is ok. The pain is much decreased and we haven’t noticed a spasm in her leg in about 2 hours! Yay!!
So am wanting to find a doctor to hurry up the process.
[2023-03-10 16:01:16] Rob Maurin: Thanks
[2023-03-10 16:01:24] Rob Maurin: We’re just sitting down to eat

[2023-03-10 17:08:16] Mom Monica Maurin: See you soon. As you know, I sent rob a list of things to bring.
[2023-03-10 17:08:43] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom is doing ok. They will give her more pain meds and take her to a room and figure out more tomorrow
[2023-03-10 17:11:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom just got more pain meds including a needle in her leg and she was happy about that.
[2023-03-10 17:12:36] Mom Monica Maurin: She said the nurse was better at needles than a mosquito :)
[2023-03-10 17:45:15] Mom Monica Maurin: FYI - We are still in emerg. In the HAIZ department. Mom goes by the name Marta Valeria Maurin.
[2023-03-10 17:49:26] Teri Smith: We’re on our way. Will be there in about 10 minutes.
[2023-03-10 17:50:34] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Great!
[2023-03-10 17:50:36] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks. Are you going straight to my car to get the shoes and then all coming into the hospital - or maybe drop dad off at the emerg entrance and I can bring him to mom?
[2023-03-10 17:51:01] Mom Monica Maurin: It’s a long enough walk from the parking to emerg. Maybe better to bring dad to the emerg entrance first
[2023-03-10 17:51:38] Teri Smith: Al and I will come in while Rob and Aidan go to the car. Rob will drop us off at emerg entrance.
[2023-03-10 17:53:41] Mom Monica Maurin: Perfect. Let me know when you’re here and I can direct you. I can meet you at the emerg entrance
[2023-03-10 17:54:48] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom is happier - she just moved her foot more. Looks like this injection in the leg really helped :)
[2023-03-10 17:58:57] Mom Monica Maurin: FYI - We are still in emerg. In the HAIZ department. Mom goes by the name Marta Valeria Maurin.
[2023-03-10 18:00:44] Teri Smith: We have arrived
[2023-03-10 20:30:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Aidan and I just got home. Will check in with everyone in the morning. Sleep well all.
[2023-03-10 20:39:24] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks. sleep beautifully!
[2023-03-10 20:49:19] Rob Maurin: Made it home.  Good night
[2023-03-10 20:51:12] Grandpa Maurin: Great, thanks a million for all your work Teri and you. Good night.
[2023-03-10 21:01:27] Mom Monica Maurin: Great. Night night.
[2023-03-10 21:07:22] Mom Monica Maurin: I just noticed that I have mom’s scarf. Sorry! Will bring it tomorrow.
‎[2023-03-11 03:56:27] Omi Maurin: ‎audio omis
[2023-03-11 04:27:05] Omi Maurin: I just got up for the washrooms again. Still a lot of pain, but manger with 1 person help. Yayyy!
I’m sitting on the chair next to the bed where you left me last night. 
MRI probably around 9 am, they say
[2023-03-11 04:46:25] Rob Maurin: Good morning mom.  Thanks for the update. I hope you got some rest
[2023-03-11 04:47:25] Rob Maurin: You’ll let us know when your back from the MRI?
[2023-03-11 04:52:50] Omi Maurin: So so
[2023-03-11 05:04:43] Rob Maurin: When we come today, is there anything you’d like us to bring?
[2023-03-11 05:11:14] Omi Maurin: Just had my healthy breakfast: part of the sandwich and the tiramisu you brought yesterday.  Thanks again!! 😘
[2023-03-11 05:12:42] Omi Maurin: Whenever. Thanks, don’t need anything. 
What‘a the weather like?  No Windows here
‎[2023-03-11 05:18:33] Mom Monica Maurin: ‎image absente
[2023-03-11 05:19:23] Mom Monica Maurin: Weather seems overcast but the snow has stopped. Yay!
Nice to hear from you mom. I’m just waking up. Aidan still asleep
[2023-03-11 05:19:57] Mom Monica Maurin: Did you get any info on whether they will give you a real room and bed today?
[2023-03-11 05:24:04] Omi Maurin: No News yet. Because of weekend I imagine not much will change
[2023-03-11 05:24:44] Mom Monica Maurin: Hmmmmm
[2023-03-11 05:25:20] Mom Monica Maurin: I imagine they will give you a bedroom soon. They probably couldn’t do more last night because there wasn’t cleaning staff to prep the room or something.
[2023-03-11 05:25:39] Mom Monica Maurin: Karin has been asking about you and sending her love
[2023-03-11 05:26:17] Mom Monica Maurin: She wants to visit as soon as you’re out of emerg and can be a bit more social.
[2023-03-11 05:27:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom, before we left the hospital last night we ensured that they have my and Rob’s names and numbers to call as well. :)
So we’ve got you covered.
[2023-03-11 05:30:03] Omi Maurin: Thanks!!!
[2023-03-11 05:31:44] Omi Maurin: Dípti, the day nurse just told me I would be transferred to a room when available. This is part of emergency.
[2023-03-11 05:32:51] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes. Excellent.
[2023-03-11 05:33:34] Mom Monica Maurin: I will come once I get organized. What do you need? Want?
[2023-03-11 05:34:03] Grandpa Maurin: Good morning all. Thanks, Vally for your update. Hope you improve today. Much ❤️ xxoo.
[2023-03-11 05:34:12] Omi Maurin: Don’t worry. 
Don’t rush!!
[2023-03-11 05:34:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok
[2023-03-11 05:34:28] Mom Monica Maurin: How are you, dad?
[2023-03-11 05:34:44] Mom Monica Maurin: Dad, have you heard from George? Do you have plans?
[2023-03-11 05:38:27] Grandpa Maurin: I am fine , slept like a log, nobody threw “lambs “ at me to wake me up !
I’m going through the morning motions. I will call George when I am ready.
[2023-03-11 05:38:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Haha. Ok :)
[2023-03-11 05:40:09] Mom Monica Maurin: I think I will rest a while longer before getting up. Feeling tired and don’t want to drive too tired. 
Everyone phone call me if I’m not seeing your text.
‎[2023-03-11 05:41:27] Grandpa Maurin: ‎image absente
[2023-03-11 05:41:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom and dad, phone any time.
[2023-03-11 05:42:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Haha! That’s a weather appropriate joke.
[2023-03-11 05:49:13] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom, do you have an iPad or something to watch stuff on? (Assuming you can get on the hospital internet? You could ask about the internet.)
[2023-03-11 05:49:41] Grandpa Maurin: There is no reason to rush today, so relax and sleep some more. If you are not well enough to drive, do not do it.  R&T, George and me are company enough for Mom.
[2023-03-11 05:52:55] Mom Monica Maurin: I will come. Let’s keep in touch about timing and errands :)
[2023-03-11 05:53:30] Grandpa Maurin: Okay
[2023-03-11 06:02:55] Omi Maurin: Don’t worry! No need for you to come!!
[2023-03-11 06:04:05] Grandpa Maurin: I agree,
[2023-03-11 06:25:51] Mom Monica Maurin: It's better for me to come today. If tomorrow it's too much, then I will stay home. And maybe by then you have been discharged (?). Also, on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday I may not be able to come because of the reno's on my house and the court stuff I've got due. Monday through Wednesday it would be great to have Rob and Teri plan to do it without me -- thank you and sorry. Those are longstanding dates I have to prepare for court and we are swamped at work. And I have contractors at home drywalling etc to fix the bathroom.
[2023-03-11 06:34:15] Omi Maurin: Which one would you prefer?

[2023-03-11 06:37:47] Mom Monica Maurin: :)
[2023-03-11 06:38:00] Mom Monica Maurin: I’m glad you’ve got options
[2023-03-11 06:48:39] Grandpa Maurin: I will take some bokchoi for you !
[2023-03-11 06:53:39] Rob Maurin: What is/was it?
[2023-03-11 07:01:24] Omi Maurin: Nice home- made ham & cheese bun and tiramisu
[2023-03-11 07:02:27] Omi Maurin: Dry waffle with dry bacon
All bran w milk
Liquid supposed to be coffee
[2023-03-11 07:02:29] Mom Monica Maurin: I'm showering and going to get ready to go. We don't have groceries here or I would make home made food. But mom I figure I can forgo that and instead be there to help you with bathroom etc today. Is that a plan??
[2023-03-11 07:03:04] Mom Monica Maurin: Perhaps dad or teri and rob can bring some food? Yesterday I only found the Tim's at the hospital.
[2023-03-11 07:03:37] Mom Monica Maurin: mom, name what else you need. I imagine I can leave here within 45 mins or so
[2023-03-11 07:03:44] Omi Maurin: DON’ T WORRY!
I’m exaggerating to make you laugh
[2023-03-11 07:03:59] Omi Maurin: Don’t rush!!!!!!
[2023-03-11 07:05:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Its just that I likely can't do much on Monday, Tuesday Wednesday so why don't I take a turn today....so I'm getting ready
[2023-03-11 07:05:09] Mom Monica Maurin: Will keep you posted on my plans
[2023-03-11 07:06:37] Omi Maurin: I’m well taken care of!
I love your company, but don’t worry about me. Life goes on !!!
Relax!
[2023-03-11 07:07:11] Omi Maurin: I had my first physio walking with a walker
[2023-03-11 07:07:26] Mom Monica Maurin: good. how did that go?
[2023-03-11 07:07:30] Rob Maurin: Wow.  How did that go?
[2023-03-11 07:07:49] Rob Maurin: Did the MRI happen?
[2023-03-11 07:08:27] Omi Maurin: Painful on left leg, but 100% better than yesterday
[2023-03-11 07:08:42] Omi Maurin: Don’t know
[2023-03-11 07:09:18] Omi Maurin: Did not happen. Don’t know when it will happen
[2023-03-11 07:09:27] Rob Maurin: Ah.  Ok
[2023-03-11 07:17:47] Mom Monica Maurin: If I can find some, mom do you want magazines? Pretty pictures to look at? might be nice when you don't have much of a view..
[2023-03-11 07:46:33] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom, the plan is that I will go get dad and then we will come to see you. 
Later on, rob and teri will come. We will keep you posted.
[2023-03-11 09:00:36] Omi Maurin: Thanks, but again don’t wry; don’t stress. 
Had a sleep and just went to the washroom with the occupational therapist. 
Now waiting for lunch and apparently after that to my room.
[2023-03-11 09:02:21] Omi Maurin: Alfonso can you pls bring the Canada Life card for possible semi private room
[2023-03-11 09:14:38] Grandpa Maurin: Okay, I have it with me. Monica just arrived to see the bathroom
[2023-03-11 13:22:36] Mom Monica Maurin: I have just dropped dad off at the apartment. I will head back to my place now. Xo
[2023-03-11 13:23:44] Rob Maurin: Mom, we’re on our way.  Need anything? A treat?
[2023-03-11 14:14:18] Grandpa Maurin: I have updated George. I am going to have my lasagna now and go to G&M for a couple of drinks at 7:30
[2023-03-11 14:50:57] Mom Monica Maurin: I just got home. All is well. Talk later. Xo
[2023-03-11 15:03:10] Rob Maurin: We got here a bit ago.  
I helped Mom into a chair. She did most of the work.  
Her dinner is now here.  Ham and scalloped potatoes

[2023-03-11 15:03:23] Mom Monica Maurin: yummy!!
[2023-03-11 15:03:26] Mom Monica Maurin: She looks lovely!!
[2023-03-11 15:03:45] Mom Monica Maurin: Did you guys get to go for a spin and a tour?
[2023-03-11 15:03:56] Rob Maurin: She chose not to
[2023-03-11 15:04:02] Mom Monica Maurin: ah ok
[2023-03-11 15:04:07] Rob Maurin: If she wants, we’ll do it later
[2023-03-11 15:04:27] Mom Monica Maurin: yup
[2023-03-11 15:04:51] Mom Monica Maurin: Enjoy your visit. I am planning to go again tomorrow morning. I will pick up dad and we will go together in the morning. Will let you know more about timing in the morning.
[2023-03-11 15:05:24] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks , Monique.
[2023-03-11 15:15:25] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey all -- with mom
[2023-03-11 15:16:16] Mom Monica Maurin: with mom's blessing and instruction I let the Weidlin side know and I've also told Loreto but also told Loreto not to tell Nenen. That's fine. All agreed. And Loreto is going to see nenen and take some dinner to her now. Loreto will let her folks know about mom. xo
[2023-03-11 17:18:44] Rob Maurin: We’re heading home now.  Mom kicked us out so she could get help for a bathroom trip.  :-)
[2023-03-11 17:19:07] Rob Maurin: Will message you when I get home, Monica, to coordinate for tomorrow
[2023-03-11 17:19:07] Mom Monica Maurin: oh ok. you read my mind. what timing. i was just wondering about you guys.
[2023-03-11 17:21:03] Rob Maurin: In case you didn’t see, this is on the door where we came in today:

[2023-03-11 17:21:20] Mom Monica Maurin: yes i saw. thank you.
[2023-03-11 17:21:37] Mom Monica Maurin: ok looking forward to your update. have a good drive home.
[2023-03-11 17:23:23] Mom Monica Maurin: mom, let me know if you want to chat when you get back to your bed. call me any time or text...
[2023-03-12 05:54:54] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
How are you all doing?
I did not have a good night. Lots of thigh cramps and pain. 
Of course the third dose of pain killers kicked in when the shift changed and I had to wake up for blood work,  blood pressure check, etc. 
I’m sitting on my chair to send you my good morning and waiting for breakfast in any 1/2 hr.
[2023-03-12 06:05:54] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi mom. Just waking up here. I’m so sorry that you had an awful night. Call if you would like to chat now!
[2023-03-12 06:59:08] Mom Monica Maurin: Aidan and I are getting into the car now. On our way to get dad. See y’all soon
[2023-03-12 07:00:03] Omi Maurin: So soon? You just woke up 😘
[2023-03-12 07:04:03] Mom Monica Maurin: Aidan and I are on our way to Mississauga. On route, we will connect with dad. He just messaged me saying he just woke up and therefore may go with George later instead. We will update you all once we connect with dad but wittier way Aidan and I are headed west. :)
[2023-03-12 07:13:01] Omi Maurin: Yes it might be better for Dad to take his time, follow his routine and not rush. That’s not a good way for him to start the day
[2023-03-12 07:20:51] Rob Maurin: Good morning mom.  Sorry you didn’t have a good night.  

Monica and I already discussed that she’s take the morning and Teri and I will come later in the day.  See you then.  Let us know if you need anything
[2023-03-12 07:23:03] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Hi Everyone, Mom and I are on our way to the Hospital. Grandpa needs a bit more time to get ready and will go with Rob or George later.
[2023-03-12 07:47:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Arriving at hospital parking lot. Will be with mom in a bit.
[2023-03-12 08:13:59] Mom Monica Maurin: We are busting out! Haha!

[2023-03-12 09:29:21] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey everyone!!! Mom moves her leg up and down now!!! Wahooo!!!
[2023-03-12 09:30:23] Rob Maurin: That’s great!!!!!
[2023-03-12 09:42:08] Grandpa Maurin: Great!
[2023-03-12 10:00:59] Mom Monica Maurin: Nelson and Teresa just arrived so we got kicked out :)
[2023-03-12 10:01:21] Rob Maurin: Oh, great that they’re visiting!
[2023-03-12 10:01:29] Mom Monica Maurin: So….any time anyone else wants to come is fair game. Sorry we couldn’t give you advanced warning but we didn’t know they were coming.
[2023-03-12 10:01:43] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom’s spirits are good :)
[2023-03-12 10:01:53] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes it’s great that they are visiting.
[2023-03-12 10:02:51] Rob Maurin: Dad, what’s your schedule/plan?
[2023-03-12 10:03:01] Mom Monica Maurin: We bought mom a longer phone charging cord so she has easier access. Rob, when you arrive please recharge mom’s little black box and then give it back to her before you leave perhaps.
[2023-03-12 10:03:08] Grandpa Maurin: Talked with George and agreed that he, probably Megan and I will go for the evening shift and will get some dinner at the Food Court.
I am relieved that I am not crazy after all: the clocks sprang forward last night.
[2023-03-12 10:03:54] Mom Monica Maurin: They clocks did spring forward. It’s had be confused too!!
[2023-03-12 10:04:37] Rob Maurin: What time are you thinking, Dad?
[2023-03-12 10:04:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Yes the little food court here has good salads!! And the nurses said that if we go there we can have a number of visitors at one time. Just remember to bundle mom up with a blanket because it’s cold there.
[2023-03-12 10:10:22] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, George and I intend to arrive at the hospital to relieve you and Teri so our time of arrival depends when you intend to leave. No problem if you and Teri remain when we are there and can all have dinner in the Food Court.
[2023-03-12 10:12:31] Rob Maurin: Ok. Thanks.  
If Nelson and Teresa are there now, I think Teri and I will aim to be there at 3:30 (unless you want some alone-time to nap, mom?).  

And then you come whenever you want, Dad.
[2023-03-12 10:17:03] Grandpa Maurin: No time for napping, I need to do my pre-op questionnaire for tomorrow, now !!!
[2023-03-12 10:20:53] Grandpa Maurin: Sorry, I thought that you were suggesting that I take a nap.
[2023-03-12 10:21:13] Rob Maurin: Not a bad idea anyway :-)
[2023-03-12 10:22:30] Grandpa Maurin: Terrific but not doable! Bye now.
[2023-03-12 11:47:36] Grandpa Maurin: Estamos con Vally. Se ve muy bien y tanto de semblante como de ánimo muy bien.
Almorzó muy poco pero algo es algo.
No costó nada llegar al hospital pero encontrar el room fue challenge.
Un abrazo
[2023-03-12 11:47:36] Grandpa Maurin: Nos estamos indo. 
Vally va a descansar 
No hay mayores novedades 
Te dejamos una cajita para ti. Pídela.
Nos comunicamos
[2023-03-12 11:48:26] Grandpa Maurin: The previous two messages are from Nelson.
[2023-03-12 11:50:22] Rob Maurin: Ok, got it.  Thanks.  We are just about to depart for the hospital.  Putting our shoes on.  So she’ll have a little rest before we get there.  We will not wake her if she’s sleeping.  I’ll let everyone know what’s what, when we arrive.
[2023-03-12 11:51:30] Grandpa Maurin: Good. Thanks Rob.
[2023-03-12 12:12:45] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you!
[2023-03-12 12:46:16] Rob Maurin: Here.  
Looks like mom had been resting. 
Now the nurse is going to give mom the stomach injection that she gets, and then help her out of bed and into the chair.  So we’ve stepped out for the moment to let them do their thing.  
I’ll report back in a bit.
[2023-03-12 12:46:34] Mom Monica Maurin: Wonderful!!
[2023-03-12 12:47:06] Mom Monica Maurin: I think that injection is helping with the cramping.
[2023-03-12 12:47:10] Mom Monica Maurin: Have a good visit.
[2023-03-12 12:48:51] Rob Maurin: Mom did mention, that the rheumatologist had been by, and is of the opinion that mom’s condition is not rheumatic at all.  
So we’ll see where that leads.  
But it’s another good sign that here at the hospital they’re doing the hard work of getting to the bottom of this mystery.
[2023-03-12 13:12:02] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for your report, Rob.
[2023-03-12 13:31:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Before I forget, on the way home I recalled that a friend of ours had what initially they thought was a stroke - she lost mobility etc for about a week - but it turns out it was a kind of migraine. And when they gave her a certain migraine medicine the condition reversed.  She made a full recovery.  It was a neurologist who realized that it was a rare form of migraine that caused a neurological issue and she couldn’t walk etc.
Mom, maybe mention this to your team?
[2023-03-12 13:33:57] Grandpa Maurin: Interesting!
[2023-03-12 13:49:24] Grandpa Maurin: How soon should George and I arrive at the hospital?
[2023-03-12 13:51:13] Omi Maurin: Whenever you want!!!!!
[2023-03-12 13:52:08] Rob Maurin: Teri and I arrived not that long ago, so there’s no specific need for you to relieve us yet.  
But come whenever is good for you.
[2023-03-12 13:54:32] Grandpa Maurin: I will meet George on P1 at 5:15.
[2023-03-12 14:14:36] Rob Maurin: Great
[2023-03-12 14:14:52] Rob Maurin: When you arrive in the parking lot, let me know
[2023-03-12 14:15:19] Rob Maurin: We will bring mom out to a seating area in the hall so that we can all sit together for a bit

[2023-03-12 16:52:54] Mom Monica Maurin: Got it.
[2023-03-12 16:53:52] Mom Monica Maurin: Are you on your own now mom? How are you doing?
[2023-03-12 16:57:07] Omi Maurin: I’m fine thanks!!
[2023-03-12 16:57:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Good.
[2023-03-12 16:57:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Call if you feel like chatting. Otherwise feel free to take a break - you’ve had a busy day :)
[2023-03-12 17:14:38] Grandpa Maurin: Hi all, I am at home. We went to The Orchard Restaurant but they close at 8. So we decided to come home, G&M invited me to have bread and butter with them but I declined so I will have something in a while and go to bed early. Thanks all for everything! Good night!!!
[2023-03-12 18:00:12] Mom Monica Maurin: Good to hear from you dad. Have a good evening. Call anytime. Xo
[2023-03-12 18:02:28] Grandpa Maurin: Good night, my love. I hope all goes well with your work next week.co

[2023-03-13 05:20:56] Mom Monica Maurin: haha!!! i generally laugh out loud at all of these calendar jokes!! So good. Thanks, Dad. How are you doing?
[2023-03-13 05:27:22] Grandpa Maurin: I’m fine , rushing a little before Alejandro & Co come at 9:00. I will be going to the Post Office to mail my hearing aid to the clinic for repair. 
Have a good day everyone!!!
[2023-03-13 05:27:45] Mom Monica Maurin: ok thanks f\or the update. let us know how to help.
[2023-03-13 06:03:23] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
Didn’t have a very good night. Lots of spasms in my leg. 
They took me down close to Tim’s for a hand x-ray. ??  I questioned it and apparently it’s to check for rheumatoid arthritis. 
The mri dept was right there, but that’s another department and they will send someone to get me when my turn comes. 
Waiting for breakfast now. 
Have a nice day everyone!
Love you all!
Thanks for everything!!
😘🥰
[2023-03-13 06:05:28] Rob Maurin: Good morning mom
Sorry to hear the night was rough.  
I’m glad they’re being methodical in their evaluations.  It makes sense to confirm the hypothesis that it’s not rheumatoid arthritis by checking out the rest of you.  

I’m aiming to see you around 12:30.
[2023-03-13 06:06:32] Mom Monica Maurin: I'm sorry mom. Can you talk? Let me know if you feel like it but no pressure at all.
[2023-03-13 06:15:45] Omi Maurin: Just found out that a patient here is waiting for an MRI since Thursday…
[2023-03-13 06:16:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh that's crappy -- well, the log jam will clear for both of you at the same time
[2023-03-13 06:19:29] Grandpa Maurin: Too bad you had a rough night again, Vallychen. Hopefully they will find the cause soon. Much love.
[2023-03-13 06:26:31] Grandpa Maurin: After my appointment George can take me to your hospital and I will take your clothes.
[2023-03-13 06:27:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Let me know if there is anything we can shop for and maybe bring over later today. The contractor is already here, and I am working....so it may be the case that this afternoon I can come. We will see. But think about a list of things I can get on the way, if possible.
[2023-03-13 06:42:58] Omi Maurin: I don’t need anything so urgently. Thanks. Please, please nobody stress about me. I’m well taken care of.
[2023-03-13 06:43:18] Mom Monica Maurin: OK. But let us know.
[2023-03-13 06:44:49] Omi Maurin: The nurse just gave me stronger pain meds, saying that the physiotherapist will come later and that she is tough. 😫. Will see…
[2023-03-13 06:46:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Try not to worry about their personalities -- plus, I wouldn't believe anyone's opinion. Just focus on your task at hand. Sending you lots of courage and strength. xo
[2023-03-13 06:48:33] Omi Maurin: They are very nice and easy going.
[2023-03-13 06:58:28] Mom Monica Maurin: They have been really nice. And the nurse may be saying that as her way of motivating people -- which may not be your idea of motivation -- so just try to put it on the back shelf of your mind......
[2023-03-13 07:26:20] Omi Maurin: Yes, no problem. I took it as such.
[2023-03-13 07:37:26] Mom Monica Maurin: Good for you!!! :)

[2023-03-13 09:27:31] Rob Maurin: (Nurse says she has gone for a “leg Doppler “)
[2023-03-13 09:27:52] Rob Maurin: I’ll hang out a bit of course, and hope we cross paths
[2023-03-13 09:28:04] Teri Smith: Oh, yay! Tests in progress is great.

[2023-03-13 09:48:20] Rob Maurin: Technician said he found two legs

[2023-03-13 10:00:13] Grandpa Maurin: George just called he wants to visit Vally now. I said yes.
[2023-03-13 10:01:37] Rob Maurin: Great
[2023-03-13 10:08:58] Aidan Maurin-Jones: WOW!! ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!
[2023-03-13 10:15:18] Rob Maurin: They’re moving mom very shortly to 3C room 355
[2023-03-13 10:15:51] Rob Maurin: I’ll send a bit more in a bit.  I have to go get dad!!
[2023-03-13 10:33:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey mom - I hear they've moved you. Let us know how it's going. I just spoke with Rob and he's just about to pick dad up.
[2023-03-13 10:55:21] Omi Maurin: I hope it’s not the palliative care floor 😉🤞🏻
[2023-03-13 10:55:36] Mom Monica Maurin: Does it look like it??
[2023-03-13 10:56:42] Omi Maurin: Not there yet. 
It takes time to arrange for a porter.
[2023-03-13 10:56:49] Mom Monica Maurin: oooohhhhh
[2023-03-13 10:56:54] Rob Maurin: Dad and I have made it to the other location.  I got great parking too!
[2023-03-13 10:56:57] Mom Monica Maurin: feel free to phone me if you want to
[2023-03-13 10:57:01] Rob Maurin: So we have tons of time
[2023-03-13 10:57:12] Mom Monica Maurin: good! good luck!
[2023-03-13 10:57:13] Omi Maurin: Great!!
[2023-03-13 11:24:27] Rob Maurin: We’re way ahead of schedule.  Blood work and ECG are done, so now we wait for the 3:00 appointment
[2023-03-13 11:25:13] Mom Monica Maurin: Wow! good for you. Relax.
[2023-03-13 11:25:17] Mom Monica Maurin: as much as possible :)
[2023-03-13 11:25:25] Mom Monica Maurin: thinking of you, dad!
[2023-03-13 11:41:07] Grandpa Maurin: Okay.I’m fine. The vampire lady was smoother than a mosquito. The ECG was uneventful, no flat lines or peaks. So we are waiting for the next event .
[2023-03-13 11:42:50] Grandpa Maurin: Have you moved, Marty?. How are you feeling now?. Much ❤️.
[2023-03-13 11:43:49] Omi Maurin: Great!!
I’m still waiting for the transfer.  Sitting in the wheelchair like an “ekeko”, surrounded by my luggage
[2023-03-13 12:43:15] Rob Maurin: Mom, we’re on our way to you.  Have you been moved?
[2023-03-13 12:43:37] Mom Monica Maurin: no word from mom
[2023-03-13 12:49:32] Mom Monica Maurin: Let me know how things are in the new room and I can call Sharon, the geriatric nurse practitioner — I have her contact info
[2023-03-13 12:52:57] Mom Monica Maurin: Here's Sharon's info:

[2023-03-13 13:06:49] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks for the message.
[2023-03-13 13:07:04] Mom Monica Maurin: Got it: New room is Room 355, bed 2
[2023-03-13 13:08:25] Mom Monica Maurin: Pls someone tell me what visiting hours are so that I and Aidan can come perhaps today...
[2023-03-13 13:26:51] Grandpa Maurin: Mom is in the 3rd floor of the old building 3 C section ,Seniors,Room 355.
[2023-03-13 13:29:01] Grandpa Maurin: Will find out about visiting hours. Do not come tonight. It is snowing.
[2023-03-13 13:36:11] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you. please find out. I have snow tires :)
[2023-03-13 13:39:39] Rob Maurin: Visiting hours are 24/7, with consideration to the fact that mom has a roommate
[2023-03-13 13:39:54] Rob Maurin: Gimme a sec for to write up more updates
[2023-03-13 13:45:37] Rob Maurin: Parking: Park in that same West lot we used over the weekend. Instead of turning left and going down the ramp, turn right. You'll pretty immediately get to the D elevators. (Don't take those elevators.) 
At the D elevators, turn right and walk down a long hall to the C elevators. 
Take C elevator to 3rd floor. 
Get off and take a hard left, and you'll promptly reach a closed door to the Senior's unit. You need to press a button to be buzzed in.
[2023-03-13 13:46:36] Rob Maurin: Mom's in 355, as you know, which is like the second room on the right. 
It's very nice. Semi-private. She has a window seat. Her roommate seems lovely (I forget her name, but will share it).
[2023-03-13 13:48:23] Omi Maurin: My roommates name is Betty
[2023-03-13 14:15:44] Rob Maurin: I've written up my notes from Dad's appointment. Rather than clog up this chat, I've put them in a doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/142s4YhJb_JS5Lr6MxsNkB6ksBGATWWA_dTcQPDCy5Xs/edit?usp=sharing
[2023-03-13 14:15:58] Rob Maurin: If this doesn't work for you, let me know and I can email it to you.
[2023-03-13 14:18:23] Grandpa Maurin: It is snowing and freezing rain, Monica do not come to Toronto. Vally is in a semiprivate room and has the window seat. The other patient is okay. This Seniors section has access controlled . Visitors must press a button to be let in.
[2023-03-13 14:47:13] Mom Monica Maurin: OK thanks. I will stay here. I only just stopped working for a while now so I haven't got it in me -- you are right. Will chat with you all later. I do intend to come tomorrow once the contractor and law firm work settles for the day. Hopefully be there mid afternoon or so. Let's keep in touch.
[2023-03-13 14:59:16] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you so much for the pre-op information, Rob. We can chat more later but that's all good info to have. Thinking of you, Dad. Sending you much love.

[2023-03-13 15:48:52] Grandpa Maurin: I am home. Unpacked your stuff and started laundry, Vally.
Thanks for your monumental report, Rob. I will digest it tonight but now I must have my delicious biscuits.
And here are the photos of the bathroom.

[2023-03-13 17:01:26] Grandpa Maurin: Alejandro says that all will be finished tomorrow . I will continue to take my showers in my own ugly looking bathroom for as long as I can lift my leg to get
[2023-03-13 17:01:50] Grandpa Maurin: Into the tub. So there !!!
[2023-03-13 17:08:51] Mom Monica Maurin: haha!! Well it's nice to have options!! I'm amazed at how well they have stuck to their schedule. That's great!
[2023-03-13 17:14:37] Grandpa Maurin: We will not look for another contractor when we want to do other renovations.
[2023-03-13 17:19:31] Teri Smith: The bathroom looks AMAZING!

[2023-03-14 05:47:59] Rob Maurin: I hope the morning improves for you, Mom.  
Karin is aiming to visit you at 10.  So Teri and I will come for 11:00
[2023-03-14 05:48:20] Omi Maurin: Yes, I didn’t have a good night. 
LOTS  of pain, like knifes stabbing into my thigh mainly. And somehow that also triggered the need to go to the washroom. 
I think I called the nurse at least every hour. I feel sorry for my neighbour Betty.
[2023-03-14 05:48:58] Mom Monica Maurin: Betty understands.
[2023-03-14 05:49:12] Mom Monica Maurin: I'm sure you already asked them if they're keeping up the pain medication.
[2023-03-14 05:49:26] Mom Monica Maurin: Do you have any idea when the doctor comes today or when the MRI is?
[2023-03-14 05:50:11] Omi Maurin: I hope I’ll be “available” for your visits. They say the doc and his team make their rounds in the morning.
[2023-03-14 05:50:43] Mom Monica Maurin: they won't take too long, i bet. write down your discussion points. xo
[2023-03-14 05:50:47] Grandpa Maurin: George and I will come at 4 pm.
[2023-03-14 05:51:27] Mom Monica Maurin: mom, would you like for Rob or I to be there when the doctor comes? to have the conversations together and take notes?
[2023-03-14 05:51:41] Mom Monica Maurin: you could possibly ask the doctor to call and update us as well?
[2023-03-14 05:51:53] Omi Maurin: Yes, they’ve given me pain meds. 
I suggested perhaps to add a muscle relaxant for these cramps
[2023-03-14 05:52:01] Mom Monica Maurin: ok
[2023-03-14 05:52:32] Omi Maurin: No need, thanks.

[2023-03-14 05:58:45] Rob Maurin: Let us know what we can bring for you
[2023-03-14 06:00:16] Mom Monica Maurin: Aidan and I made some yummy thai carrot soup - it's mild but yummy. How about I bring that and a salad, mom? and I can also bring you some homemade granola. Does that sound ok?
[2023-03-14 06:00:45] Mom Monica Maurin: i also am charging my ipad mini -- would you like to hang onto that so you can watch videos online? It doesn't matter if it goes missing -- really.
[2023-03-14 06:01:38] Mom Monica Maurin: (the ipad used to be aidan's and he gave it to kai and then to me....it's an oldie but still works and we are happy to let you have it.._
[2023-03-14 06:02:18] Omi Maurin: Dr Chandrakumar just came by. Very nice and gentle. He thinks everything comes from my back. Hoping to get the MRI of my lower back done today
[2023-03-14 06:03:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Excellent!!! That's making some sense!
[2023-03-14 06:03:11] Mom Monica Maurin: How to you feel about that?
[2023-03-14 06:04:32] Omi Maurin: Please don’t bring too many things. No place to keep it.

[2023-03-14 10:30:44] Rob Maurin: Dad, I spoke to Cecilia (the nurse) about your blood test.  I’ve put the information at the END of the document I created yesterday:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/142s4YhJb_JS5Lr6MxsNkB6ksBGATWWA_dTcQPDCy5Xs/edit
[2023-03-14 10:31:04] Rob Maurin: If that link or document doesn’t work for anyone, let me know.
[2023-03-14 10:31:41] Rob Maurin: Short version: an iron infusion  would be helpful but not essential.  Your call.
[2023-03-14 10:35:28] Grandpa Maurin: Many thanks, Rob, of course I want to have the infusion. Thanks again !
[2023-03-14 10:42:58] Mom Monica Maurin: I just finished work. Aidan and I are going to pack up and come visit mom!
[2023-03-14 10:43:38] Mom Monica Maurin: Please tell us if you want us to bring anything/buy anything for you on our way?
[2023-03-14 10:44:16] Mom Monica Maurin: Dad, do you need anything? We can also pick you up or come and visit -- just let us know.
[2023-03-14 10:49:39] Grandpa Maurin: I will go with George, eta 4:15 pm. Many thanks.

[2023-03-14 11:37:15] Aidan Maurin-Jones: ‎Localisation: https://maps.google.com/?q=43.647079,-79.363716
[2023-03-14 11:37:42] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Ok thank you!
[2023-03-14 12:10:13] Rob Maurin: I don’t have detailed directions for getting to mom from the main door, but roughly speaking: 

Come in the main door and follow the signs (or ask for directions) to the C elevator.  
Take C up to 3rd floor.  

Turn sharp left to the Senior doors.  Press the buzzer to get buzzed in.  Mom’s room is the second on the right.  #355
[2023-03-14 12:11:06] Rob Maurin: Worth noting: you have to take C elevator.  Any other elevator will not bring you to Mom’s ward as far as I can tell.
[2023-03-14 12:15:40] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Got it, thanks
[2023-03-14 12:29:06] Rob Maurin: We’re heading out now.  Mom is comfy in her wheelchair so if you want to go for a spin that will be easy.  If you’re all here together (Dad, George, Monica, Aidan) you will have to go somewhere else to hang out, because it’s a two-person max.  Best option we’ve found for hanging out with a group is the food court on the LOWEST level.
[2023-03-14 12:29:11] Rob Maurin: Chat later!
[2023-03-14 12:35:36] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Ok thanks
[2023-03-14 12:36:34] Omi Maurin: Past Tim Horton’s is an information desk. There they might give you a map on how to get here.
[2023-03-14 12:39:39] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Great, thanks
[2023-03-14 12:41:29] Grandpa Maurin: To avoid overcrowding Vally’s room George and I will arrive after 6 pm
[2023-03-14 12:43:28] Omi Maurin: Alejandro sent me pictures and video of the finished bathroom. 
Very nice of him. Nice bathroom!!!
[2023-03-14 12:45:24] Grandpa Maurin: Yes , it is done. He will come tomorrow to collect the balance.
[2023-03-14 15:28:16] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom went hunting for a map to share with everyone. And then we took a few routes to find the most direct route from the Mail entrance. Here it is!!!……

[2023-03-14 15:32:08] Rob Maurin: Thank you!
[2023-03-14 15:33:18] Mom Monica Maurin: The trick is to walk in the main entrance, past Tim’s, past the info desk and then you walk down the hallway between the two little stores and bob’s your uncle! You’ll be at C elevators in no time.
[2023-03-14 15:36:38] Mom Monica Maurin: When you get up to the third floor turn left to get to the seniors area.
[2023-03-14 15:50:18] Rob Maurin: Monica/Dad, what do you have in mind for visits tomorrow? I was thinking of heading over in the morning, maybe aiming for 10.
[2023-03-14 16:47:07] Omi Maurin: Dad is going to the podiatrist. 
I’m waiting for 2 MRIs. They say they will call from downstairs when available. The don’t know when.
[2023-03-14 16:49:10] Mom Monica Maurin: I am working in the morning and until at the very least 1 pm. I have no sense of whether I will be able to visit mom tomorrow or not. 
Daniela Kibedi mentioned she would like to visit mom but I have not got details on that yet. Pls tell me if you have a preference as to when I could suggest she visit mom.
[2023-03-14 16:49:13] Grandpa Maurin: I have a 12:30 appointment with the Chiropodist. I will come sometime late with George
[2023-03-14 16:49:32] Mom Monica Maurin: FYI we just got home :)
[2023-03-14 16:51:57] Grandpa Maurin: I prefer the very late shift because I live close by
[2023-03-14 16:58:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok.
[2023-03-14 16:58:46] Mom Monica Maurin: So maybe I will mention to Daniela to come middayish
[2023-03-14 17:03:13] Rob Maurin: Great.  It’s a plan!
[2023-03-14 17:03:52] Omi Maurin: Please, please don’t worry.  I love your company, but I won’t cry if nobody can come.
[2023-03-14 17:16:34] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. Well I will let you all know if Daniela can make it and when. And as for me, I will have to play it by ear tomorrow. 
And mom, you can call me or text all night long. I am often awake. If I am asleep I simply won’t see the text. I don’t hear them come in. If you want to talk just phone. I will hear that. No problem.
[2023-03-14 17:17:02] Rob Maurin: Ditto
[2023-03-14 17:22:05] Omi Maurin: Thanks again and again!!!!
[2023-03-14 17:22:34] Mom Monica Maurin: Xoxo it was so nice to see you today!!
[2023-03-14 17:50:01] Mom Monica Maurin: Daniela will try to go midday tomorrow. :) she is looking forward to seeing you mom. And she also offered to help dad in any way.
[2023-03-14 17:50:17] Rob Maurin: Nice!
[2023-03-14 17:51:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Night night all. Feel free to call or text any time. Really
[2023-03-14 17:51:47] Mom Monica Maurin: Enjoy the iPad mom.

[2023-03-14 17:59:45] Grandpa Maurin: Good night Vallychen. Let’s hope the pain goes to sleep too. Much ❤️!
[2023-03-15 04:34:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning everyone. Mom and dad, I hope you both slept well. Xoxo
[2023-03-15 05:02:09] Omi Maurin: Good morning! 🌞
How is everyone doing today?
Again, I didn’t have a good night. The spasms and stabbing pain seems to prepare all day to start giving me a hard time when I go to bed. 
I’m up now. “me solita” went to the washroom and changed to a clean nightgown. I almost feel human 😉
[2023-03-15 05:06:32] Mom Monica Maurin: Wow!!! You’re amazing!
[2023-03-15 05:07:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Will the doctor come again today and you have him increase the pain killers at night?
[2023-03-15 05:08:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Can you try being super propped up in bed with pillows behind you and under your knees to mimic the seated position? And try sleeping like that?
[2023-03-15 05:09:33] Omi Maurin: I tried, but it didn’t work.
[2023-03-15 05:09:44] Mom Monica Maurin: Drat
[2023-03-15 05:09:47] Mom Monica Maurin: Want to chat?
[2023-03-15 05:09:51] Mom Monica Maurin: Call any time
[2023-03-15 05:10:31] Omi Maurin: Too much going on here to chat
[2023-03-15 05:10:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok
[2023-03-15 05:13:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Call any time you see you want to/can. I am working from home.
[2023-03-15 05:13:53] Mom Monica Maurin: I believe  rob is coming to see you this morning and Daniela midday and dad later in the day. And I am hoping for this afternoon but will keep you posted.
[2023-03-15 05:23:48] Grandpa Maurin: I will go with George to do the late shift.

[2023-03-15 07:22:56] Mom Monica Maurin: Good!!!
[2023-03-15 07:23:30] Mom Monica Maurin: Plan B is to get his home number and call him every time you have a cramp tonight.
[2023-03-15 07:23:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Daniela has confirmed she is coming today. So sweet.
[2023-03-15 07:25:42] Omi Maurin: Brilliant idea!!

[2023-03-15 08:16:38] Mom Monica Maurin: ❤️❤️❤️👍
[2023-03-15 08:17:35] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey all, I called George to ask about how he and Megan and doing and he told me he couldn’t chat long because he was having a CT scan this morning, which he said was routine for him. Just letting you know. We got cut off so I was not able to get any details about how he and Megan are today.
[2023-03-15 08:30:16] Grandpa Maurin: Yes, he is having that routine 
test this morning. He and I will visit Mom for the last shift today.
I am going to the Chiropodist in a while. Also routine, abundant parking next to the building door, no confusing elevators and no need to hold your pee for lack of facilities. I have to get ready, bye for now.
[2023-03-15 08:39:25] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. May the force me with you, dad!! Glad this trek is routine. I like (good) routines!
[2023-03-15 09:01:44] Mom Monica Maurin: George just confirmed that Megan is 'doing ok' and that he is done his CT and will go to the hospital at the end of the day with dad.
[2023-03-15 09:03:44] Mom Monica Maurin: And I messaged with Nenen and she knows everyone is doing ok -- she also sounds like she is doing better. That's all for now brown cow. Back to work for me...
[2023-03-15 09:17:38] Rob Maurin: Mom’s lunch has arrived.  
Nurse says that the occupational therapist will come to help mom walk (with the walker we assume) in the afternoon, so mom will get some meds now to make that less painful.  
Still waiting for the MRI.  Mom says that when they have an opening at the machine they will call up.
[2023-03-15 09:25:48] Grandpa Maurin: Many thanks for your reports Robert and Monica. I have just arrived at the “patólogo”.
[2023-03-15 09:52:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok Xo
[2023-03-15 11:03:32] Rob Maurin: Teri and I are just leaving.  Daniela is here. She arrived nearly an hour ago, I think.  
The occupational therapist just arrived and will work with mom a bit.  Daniela is staying a little longer too.
[2023-03-15 11:08:42] Rob Maurin: A stranger just told me you can buy 5 or 10 day parking passes at the parking garage office.  Something like $40 for the 5 day and you can come and go as much as you like!

[2023-03-17 04:49:44] Omi Maurin: Good morning everyone!!!  🌞⛱️🙏
I had the best nigh for a long time. The cramps only woke me up a few time and I asked quickly for meds. 
I slept in the bed and I think I’d still be sleeping if it wasn’t for the nurses waking everyone up for bloodwork, etc.
[2023-03-17 04:55:11] Mom Monica Maurin: Yahoooooo!!!

[2023-03-17 06:18:42] Omi Maurin: The doctor just came by. He is frustrated about no MRI news. Nurse continues checking. 
He has requested a muscle specialist lo check me as well. 
I slept better because he ordered an anti-inflammatory in my mix of evening pills
[2023-03-17 06:20:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Excellent news on all counts, mom. I am glad that the delay is on his mind and that he's thinking of other ways to help you. That's great.

[2023-03-17 14:24:59] Mom Monica Maurin: I am with mom but Aidan is not here today. Can I help you?
[2023-03-17 14:28:25] Grandpa Maurin: It is a computer issue that we had worked on before . How late are you staying Monique?
[2023-03-17 14:37:16] Mom Monica Maurin: I can stay as long as you guys want me to. Not an issue for me.

Just as everything kicked in, and right after mom went to the washroom I overheard her name and MRI spoken. Within seconds they came in and we all got her ready in half a minute. She was helped into a stretcher and we came down. She’s in it right now. I will let you know when done.  Yayyyy!!!
[2023-03-17 15:40:44] Grandpa Maurin: We just arrived
[2023-03-17 15:44:03] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. I am in the MRI department. I don’t think you can come in. I will wait here to be with mom when she is done. I will update you when I know anything more
[2023-03-17 15:45:04] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom just finished. We are on our way back up to her room
[2023-03-17 15:45:15] Mom Monica Maurin: I haven’t seen her yet. Just overheard the plan
[2023-03-17 15:49:02] Grandpa Maurin: George and I are in Vally’s room
[2023-03-17 16:03:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom is done and back in her room and she’s doing great. They did BOTH MRIs!!! Wahoooo!!!!!!
[2023-03-17 16:22:42] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Great!
[2023-03-17 16:29:21] Grandpa Maurin: Monica has just left the room on her way home. Vally looks very nice and in good spirits. George and I will be here for while.

[2023-03-18 04:51:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Omg. The punchline. Didn’t even see it coming.
[2023-03-18 05:10:26] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
How are y’all??
I had a rough night at the beginning, but then slept like a log. 
I think I’ll crawl Bach into bed now. 
😘🥰😉
[2023-03-18 05:11:27] Grandpa Maurin: Have a good nap!.
[2023-03-18 06:11:58] Mom Monica Maurin: Excellent. Sleep in well!
[2023-03-18 06:21:03] Omi Maurin: The physiotherapist came while I was having my luxurious breakfast,  to do physio with me. I told him abt the MRIs last night and asked if he had any results. He went and checked and came back saying he would not do physio today he would let Dr ?? talk to me about the MRI results.  
To be continued…
[2023-03-18 06:21:55] Rob Maurin: Interesting.  
Teri and I are aiming to leave home in the next 15 min or so.  See you soon.  Need/want anything?
[2023-03-18 06:22:02] Rob Maurin: Some vegetables?
[2023-03-18 06:22:51] Omi Maurin: Nothing. Thanks
Ate more kiwi 🥝 this morning
[2023-03-18 06:27:21] Grandpa Maurin: I will prepare a replacement order of kiwis to be delivered this evening .
[2023-03-18 06:29:02] Omi Maurin: I think I had enough 🥝 for a day. Thanks!
😘
[2023-03-18 06:31:36] Grandpa Maurin: Okay. I will have my breakfast now.
[2023-03-18 06:32:13] Omi Maurin: Enjoy!!
[2023-03-18 06:35:35] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok mom. I will visit you this afternoon. Probably around 3 or 4 but will let you know either way.
[2023-03-18 06:36:01] Mom Monica Maurin: Likely the physio doesn’t want to force anything until he gets the all clear. Likely not anything wrong. Just professional caution.

[2023-03-18 09:43:31] Rob Maurin: We’ve been hanging out with mom in her room for a bit, but will now go for a wander.  
The weekend doctor is expected around 3:00, so we’ll be back by 2:30 to be safe.
[2023-03-18 09:44:24] Rob Maurin: It’s very possible that we’ll only get a little insight from the doctor, since it’s only the weekend doctor and not the “MRP” — most responsible physician.
[2023-03-18 09:49:54] Rob Maurin: Heading out for a spin now
[2023-03-18 09:59:13] Omi Maurin: W Teri and Rob at the food court
[2023-03-18 10:00:12] Omi Maurin: Will be back in my room by 2:30 
Dr apparently coming around that time. 🙏🤞🏻
[2023-03-18 10:26:35] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for the information. I just returned from my shopping safari at Walmart. Got 4 boxes of new COVID test kit expiring March 2024 called Flowflex.
Stopped at Lazio bakery and they had warm buns that I will eat Chilean style, i e with mashed paltas. 
Hope the doctor will disclose the findings of the MRIs. Have fun.
[2023-03-18 10:28:56] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi all. I just got back from my class. I will take care of a few things and maybe head out in an hour or so to see mom. Will keep you posted.
[2023-03-18 11:13:16] Mom Monica Maurin: Gonna be a bit delayed. Will let you know when I’m leaving
[2023-03-18 11:13:59] Omi Maurin: Don’t worry!!!!!
[2023-03-18 12:07:52] Mom Monica Maurin: On my way to mom:)
[2023-03-18 12:08:35] Grandpa Maurin: Okay, thanks
[2023-03-18 12:35:23] Grandpa Maurin: George and I will arrive at the THP Mississauga about 7:20 pm. I intend to take nap now.

[2023-03-18 13:29:00] Rob Maurin: We just talked to a doctor about the MRI.  I’ve written up my recollection here

[2023-03-18 13:29:13] Rob Maurin: If anyone has trouble with this, let me know.
[2023-03-18 13:57:49] Mom Monica Maurin: Dad, we can discuss and  explain more later of course when we see you. I’m at the hospital now with mom.
[2023-03-18 15:17:19] Grandpa Maurin: I just woke up. I read the report. I have to digest it. See you soon.

Aidan will help grandpa with computer stuff and then he will drop him off to visit omi. See y”all tomorrow.
[2023-03-18 19:49:13] Rob Maurin: We’ll aim for an afternoon visit, then
[2023-03-19 05:13:29] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
How are you all doing?
I had a so so night. Not the staving, cramping pain, but a dull, almost constant pain. 
Will be getting pain meds soon. Renitha, the nurse, also gave me a brisk leg massage with Voltaren.
[2023-03-19 05:16:05] Rob Maurin: Good morning mom
[2023-03-19 05:17:07] Rob Maurin: Another rough night.  Booo

[2023-03-19 07:08:46] Mom Monica Maurin: Arriving at hospital parking lot. Aidan is with grandpa. I will be with mom momentarily!
[2023-03-19 07:24:23] Mom Monica Maurin: Mission accomplished. With mom.

[2023-03-19 10:48:36] Omi Maurin: We are heading up to the room now
[2023-03-19 11:13:23] Grandpa Maurin: Confirmed., G, M and I will depart for the THP Mississauga at 7 p m.

[2023-03-19 12:24:40] Grandpa Maurin: Good for a change!
[2023-03-19 12:26:03] Mom Monica Maurin: :)
[2023-03-19 12:28:42] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for your help, Aidan. We accomplished quite bit tidying up the apartment
[2023-03-19 12:29:18] Grandpa Maurin: I opened the Acer and so far so good.
[2023-03-19 12:31:13] Aidan Maurin-Jones: No worries, glad to hear :)
[2023-03-19 14:21:37] Rob Maurin: We went down to Tim’s with mom for a while, and made sure she was back in time for meds and dinner.  Her dinner just arrived (schnitzel and corn 🌽😁) so we’re leaving mom to have her dinner.  

I will come back early in the morning tomorrow.  The doctor tends to make his rounds between 9 and 10, so I’ll definitely be here in time for that.
[2023-03-19 14:21:50] Rob Maurin: Dad, how are you? Need anything?
[2023-03-19 15:29:06] Grandpa Maurin: Rob, good that you will be with Mom when the doctor makes his round. Thanks, I do not need anything for now.
[2023-03-19 18:13:15] Grandpa Maurin: I’m home, ready to eat.

[2023-03-20 04:48:22] Omi Maurin: Good morning!!
The best night so far!!!!
Not much pain.  Too bad they started doing stuff in the hallway around 5 am. I thought it was Betty, impatient to go home, but she is still here.
[2023-03-20 04:56:40] Rob Maurin: En route!
[2023-03-20 05:16:17] Grandpa Maurin: Great news, Vallychen. Much ❤️

[2023-03-20 05:59:53] Rob Maurin: I’m here with mom.  I’ll update when there’s any news!
[2023-03-20 06:00:48] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks, Rob.
[2023-03-20 06:02:57] Rob Maurin: Mom’s poor roommate is all packed and dressed and ready to go home, and they’re now keeping her longer because her blood sugar is still too high.  
Poor thing.  Must be so disappointing.
[2023-03-20 06:04:59] Mom Monica Maurin: Yipppeeeeeee!!!!!
[2023-03-20 06:05:14] Mom Monica Maurin: Oh honey.  Feel for her.
[2023-03-20 06:05:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Which reminds me about my wilting plants!
[2023-03-20 06:06:03] Grandpa Maurin: Too bad for Betty.
[2023-03-20 07:36:35] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi all - any news from the doctors? Mom, how are you?
[2023-03-20 07:41:13] Rob Maurin: We just saw the doctor. I am writing up my notes right now.
[2023-03-20 07:48:06] Rob Maurin: Here’s my summary:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/10RppFbf3yiK2YvjvXJUdIq0037JDuyw2YhrIQghT6Wg/edit
[2023-03-20 07:48:27] Rob Maurin: If it doesn’t work for you, let me know
[2023-03-20 07:49:04] Rob Maurin: This document is shareable, if anyone wants to send it to Eduardo
[2023-03-20 07:56:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Thank you for the summary. Mom, would you like to chat now or later? Just digesting the info - which in a way so far sounds better than in the weekend. Sending you much love.
[2023-03-20 08:00:44] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for your report, Rob. I’m trying to digest it.
[2023-03-20 08:22:15] Rob Maurin: One thing I forgot to add to the document: They will continue trying to tweak the cocktail for pain management
[2023-03-20 08:23:24] Grandpa Maurin: 👍
[2023-03-20 08:33:06] Mom Monica Maurin: Excellent. Really glad to hear that - so that mom can get some rest and feel way better.
[2023-03-20 08:39:12] Rob Maurin: We just had another visit, this time from the “senior medical student.” So not quite a doctor, but someone doing his residency.  And the good thing is that he came and asked mom lots of questions — everything from pain to mobility — and we made sure to reinforce the details of what’s working and what’s not and what hurts.  So it’s one more person who can advocate on mom’s behalf when they have their meetings.  
And he very specifically made time to ask if we had questions.  We reiterated to him our understanding of the situation and of what we believed would happen in the next few days (i.e. what I wrote in the document) and he confirmed that this was correct.  We pressed him on what mom might expect in terms of recovery and he said we have to wait to hear from the physiatrist and physiotherapist before anyone can answer that.  

So, in short, no new insights but frankly a very good opportunity to confirm that we understood things.
[2023-03-20 08:40:27] Rob Maurin: Oh, and mom and I went for a spin.  Neither of us wanted to eat or drink, so we just went exploring for 45 minutes or so
[2023-03-20 08:43:34] Grandpa Maurin: The student doctor will take an interest in Mom’s case and that is encouraging.
[2023-03-20 08:44:28] Grandpa Maurin: May be you will run into the coyotes!
[2023-03-20 08:54:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Excellent about the resident - yes I believe he will be an asset! Things are sorting themselves out. Thank you for your patience and perseverance mom. You have had a long road of pain on this and now there are finally answers.  Within days you will have a real treatment plan and real help. I love you. Hang in there. We will do everything we can to make it better. Xox
[2023-03-20 08:55:39] Grandpa Maurin: I agree with you , Monica.
[2023-03-20 09:25:31] Teri Smith: For what it’s worth, our friend Shari (retired physiotherapist) has been asking for updates, so I just sent her Rob’s notes. She sends her best to Vally, and also said:

You'd be amazed at how quickly things can turn around once she has good pain control, some reassurance that she's not doing damage when she moves and a little guidance on how to move.
[2023-03-20 09:31:41] Grandpa Maurin: Good advice!
[2023-03-20 09:42:12] Omi Maurin: The physiotherapist just came by and said she wants to do some gentle exercises after lunch. She ordered a stronger pain killer for half an hour before she comes.
[2023-03-20 10:02:13] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. How are you doing, mom? Xox
[2023-03-20 10:04:40] Grandpa Maurin: Good to see that they are moving.
[2023-03-20 10:05:27] Omi Maurin: Ok thanks. 
Don’t worry!!!!
[2023-03-20 10:19:29] Mom Monica Maurin: :)
[2023-03-20 10:19:41] Mom Monica Maurin: I miss you and look forward to chatting later today!
[2023-03-20 11:01:29] Rob Maurin: FYI, as we plan visits for tomorrow: Karin is thinking she will come at around 12:30.
[2023-03-20 11:05:43] Omi Maurin: I just walked over 15 m with the walker  under the effect of hydro morphine.  It worked great.
[2023-03-20 11:06:08] Teri Smith: Excellent!!
[2023-03-20 11:23:37] Grandpa Maurin: Wonderful news Vallychen love ❤️
[2023-03-20 11:24:47] Mom Monica Maurin: Holy AMAZING!!!!!!! Oh my God you’re a trooper, Mom!!!!!
[2023-03-20 11:39:10] Mom Monica Maurin: I intend to be there tomorrow at about 3 pm.
[2023-03-20 11:55:00] Rob Maurin: Dad and I are meeting at 9:45, and then heading to his appointments. Most likely that will occupy us until about 2:30 pm. 

I'll check in with everyone and determine if/when I/we go to the hospital.
[2023-03-20 11:59:50] Omi Maurin: Thanks for arranging for all these visits and appointments. Don’t worry about me. I LOVE to have you here all day, but you need to continue your routine as well!
[2023-03-20 12:40:45] Kai Maurin-Jones: That's amazing news!!
[2023-03-20 13:23:55] Omi Maurin: Just walked around the “whole block” with the student nurse
I hadn’t seen much of my nurse today, just heard a woman with a Spanish accent. 
Her name is Ludmila and she is from Cuba
[2023-03-20 13:24:34] Rob Maurin: That's pretty amazing!
[2023-03-20 13:26:41] Grandpa Maurin: Wow, that’s a lot of walking, congratulations!
[2023-03-20 13:30:51] Omi Maurin: It helps “to have connections “. I’ve been asking for a couple of days to have that needle removed from my hand. There is always an excuse: perhaps later, that I might need it, we have to ask the doctor, etc
I asked the student nurse a couple of times and he asked Ludmila, same excuses all day. 
When I finally met Ludmila in person and we exchanged a couple of sentences in Spanish  she inquired with the doctor and it’s off!!!  Yayy !!
[2023-03-20 13:33:01] Grandpa Maurin: Good for you!
[2023-03-20 16:27:13] Kai Maurin-Jones: That's so nice!
[2023-03-20 18:30:09] Grandpa Maurin: I’m home and hungry. Good night all !!!
[2023-03-20 18:30:54] Rob Maurin: Good night!
[2023-03-20 19:44:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Good night. Xo
[2023-03-21 04:39:42] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning everybody. I hope you had a good sleep :)
[2023-03-21 04:57:52] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
I had a good sleep, but not as deep as the night before   Still good 👍.

Don’t worry to make it, if traffic is bad.
[2023-03-21 06:10:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Big yay for Marty!
[2023-03-21 06:10:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Good luck with your appointments today, Dad!!
[2023-03-21 06:18:57] Rob Maurin: I just had a super quick visit with mom. I left when the occupational therapist arrived to take mom for a walk. But that meant that I got to see mom walking with the OT. It was amazing. Mom looked strong and confident, and (I was counting) her pace is almost exactly one step per second. So if you look at a clock and measure that tempo, that’s a pretty good walking pace. 
On my way to pick up dad now.
[2023-03-21 06:20:15] Teri Smith: Amazing! Great work, Marty!
[2023-03-21 06:21:00] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks. I will be going down momentarily.Fabulous!
[2023-03-21 06:47:13] Mom Monica Maurin: That’s absolutely wonderful!! I’m amazed you’re so speedy, mom!!!! There must be another party soon!!
[2023-03-21 08:35:25] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Amazing!!
[2023-03-21 08:42:49] Rob Maurin: Dad and I are hanging out at his appointments.  We’ve seen a nurse already.  Waiting on a pharmacist to review dad’s meds, and then we have a chat with the anesthesiologist.  

Then we’ll go get a knee x-ray.  

Then we’ll do the iron infusion.
[2023-03-21 08:43:02] Rob Maurin: Then we’ll go to the bar and drink tequila.
[2023-03-21 08:43:48] Teri Smith: Don’t forget to ask someone(?) about walker/cane requirements.
[2023-03-21 08:44:09] Rob Maurin: Got it
[2023-03-21 08:45:41] Teri Smith: The woman at the gym I mentioned before who recently had knee replacement said she only used a walker for a few days, then a cane for 2-3 weeks. Amazing! She (like everyone else) emphasized the need to do the exercises. They might hurt at first, but do them.
[2023-03-21 08:45:42] Omi Maurin: You’ll deserve it!! 👏🏼👍🥰
[2023-03-21 09:14:45] Rob Maurin: Done with the pharmacist.  On to the anesthesiologist next.
[2023-03-21 09:40:26] Rob Maurin: Done with the anesthesiologist.  He was super nice. 

Next up: x-rays!
[2023-03-21 10:02:53] Mom Monica Maurin: Did you remember to ask about staying longer in hospital because mom is also laid up?
[2023-03-21 10:02:56] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks rob
[2023-03-21 10:03:23] Mom Monica Maurin: FYI I am stuck at work. Will let you know when I am finished and can head out. Sorry. Busy day at work ….
[2023-03-21 10:13:13] Rob Maurin: X-rays are done.  Now iron
[2023-03-21 10:15:46] Omi Maurin: Don’t worry Mo!!  Don’t come!!
[2023-03-21 10:20:33] Rob Maurin: I will see if there’s someone I can ask, but i think there’s nobody here who can speak to this.  I’ll call the doctor’s office if I can’t find out here
[2023-03-21 10:30:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Sorry mediation is tomorrow. I’m still working. Will message you when I’m done.
[2023-03-21 10:38:01] Omi Maurin: Please don’t worry about me. I’ll be more stressed if you come. 
Pls don’t come!!!!!!!
[2023-03-21 11:03:11] Rob Maurin: Did Karin visit?
[2023-03-21 11:03:30] Rob Maurin: Dad is now resting in a bed, getting a butt-load of iron (that's a medical term).
[2023-03-21 11:03:41] Rob Maurin: I've written up my notes from today in a document here:
[2023-03-21 11:03:42] Rob Maurin: https://docs.google.com/document/d/136nClhIz8_4CAGwrmLIXDQN1nFxlqf5qXQk21PJr5yA/edit?usp=sharing
[2023-03-21 11:04:06] Rob Maurin: The infusion will take 2 1/2 hours! So I'll pop over and pay you another visit, mom!
[2023-03-21 11:08:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Just logged off of work. Gonna get ready to go to mom. 
Dad - we love you and hope that it’s going ok for you. Sending gentle hugs!!
[2023-03-21 11:09:07] Omi Maurin: She is here right now
[2023-03-21 11:16:01] Rob Maurin: Are you in your room? Or should I meet you down in the food court?
[2023-03-21 11:51:21] Mom Monica Maurin: I’m
Heading to moms hospital.
[2023-03-21 12:54:43] Mom Monica Maurin: Arrived at moms hospital. See you soon mom. I’m heading up from the parking lot. 
Dad, I hope you’re doing well. Xox
[2023-03-21 13:04:30] Mom Monica Maurin: With mom now!
[2023-03-21 13:08:18] Rob Maurin: I’m back with dad now.  
The iron is done, and now they’re “flushing the line” with what I assume is saline.  Basically making sure his infusion is Good to the Last Drop™️. 
When we’re done here, I will take dad home.  He will report later on, how he is doing, and whether he’s up for a visit tonight or not.
[2023-03-21 13:08:41] Rob Maurin: Dad and I just made the same “good to the last drop” joke
[2023-03-21 13:26:03] Teri Smith: Haha. Of course you did!
[2023-03-21 13:29:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Haha!!!
[2023-03-21 13:29:38] Mom Monica Maurin: Please say hi to dad for us and give him a hug and a gentle high five for a job well done!
‎[2023-03-21 13:33:32] Rob Maurin: ‎image absente
[2023-03-21 13:34:02] Rob Maurin: All done.  Needle is out.  Just waiting a minute to make sure there’s no bleeding from the needle site
[2023-03-21 13:38:35] Rob Maurin: And off we go! Dad is back on his feet and we’re making our way to the car.  After a pee stop :-)
[2023-03-21 13:42:31] Mom Monica Maurin: Yayyyy!!!
[2023-03-21 13:42:35] Omi Maurin: Yayyyy!
[2023-03-21 13:42:41] Mom Monica Maurin: How are you doing, dad?
[2023-03-21 13:43:47] Omi Maurin: One worry behind you!!!
[2023-03-21 14:20:13] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom and I are in the cafeteria if anyone is looking for us.
[2023-03-21 14:20:41] Rob Maurin: Thanks. I’ve dropped dad off at home, and will now head home myself. Have a good night.
[2023-03-21 14:21:15] Mom Monica Maurin: Is dad up for a visit from
Me later?
Do you know if dad is coming to see mom today?
[2023-03-21 14:21:54] Omi Maurin: Thanks. Have a nice evening.
[2023-03-21 14:22:17] Rob Maurin: I’m not sure if he knows the answer himself. He was going to evaluate that. You’ll have to ask him.
[2023-03-21 14:22:35] Mom Monica Maurin: Fair enough. Thanks
[2023-03-21 14:22:51] Mom Monica Maurin: Dad, I will let you be and you can let me know what you need. Xo
[2023-03-21 14:29:55] Grandpa Maurin: Hello everyone! I’m home. I intend to go and visit Mother but let me check with George first. Thanks
[2023-03-21 14:30:39] Mom Monica Maurin: Wowie!!! You’re a super star dad!!

[2023-03-22 05:05:26] Omi Maurin: My night ok   How about you?
[2023-03-22 05:08:07] Omi Maurin: Betty, my neighbour. Is leaving 🥲. Her sugar seems to be ok, but she keeps complaining that she is hungry and wants a cookie 😉
[2023-03-22 05:16:53] Grandpa Maurin: I’m okay. Nothing new in these parts. Will shower, have breakfast and read all the literature I got yesterday. Bye for now.
[2023-03-22 05:19:18] Omi Maurin: Enjoy!! 😘

No coyote in sight
[2023-03-22 09:05:58] Mom Monica Maurin: :)
[2023-03-22 09:30:43] Rob Maurin: How are you feeling today? Dad? Any different now that you’re full of iron? Did you sleep OK?
[2023-03-22 09:38:25] Rob Maurin: On our way!
[2023-03-22 09:41:44] Omi Maurin: New neighbour just moving in.

[2023-03-22 10:30:17] Aidan Maurin-Jones: 👍
[2023-03-22 10:31:12] Omi Maurin: ‎Localisation: https://maps.google.com/?q=43.571270,-79.608253
[2023-03-22 10:38:01] Grandpa Maurin: I was a little tired when I woke up but since I have to do a normal life to exercise my legs I went to Costco and then Loblaws and now I’m more tired physically but mentally happier. 
Have a nice visit with Vallychen.
[2023-03-22 10:41:57] Mom Monica Maurin: Good for you dad!
[2023-03-22 10:42:08] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom, I hope your new neighbour is awesome
[2023-03-22 10:48:35] Rob Maurin: The infusion didn’t give you any superpowers?
[2023-03-22 10:59:15] Grandpa Maurin: No, no superpowers! I’m going to eat something and sleep without the alarm clock!
[2023-03-22 11:56:10] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Sleep well :)
[2023-03-22 11:57:08] Aidan Maurin-Jones: On the bus on my way home. @14168289762, @16479938374 & @19056091946  are in the Cafeteria on the ground floor.
[2023-03-22 11:57:55] Omi Maurin: Thanks for coming 😘
[2023-03-22 13:07:40] Rob Maurin: I have a hunch dad will like this:
‎[2023-03-22 13:07:44] Rob Maurin: ‎image absente
[2023-03-22 13:12:22] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Oh god… 🤣
[2023-03-22 13:14:41] Grandpa Maurin: Very good. Now we know!!!
[2023-03-22 13:16:23] Grandpa Maurin: I sent Aidan photos of the bloody papers with the sessions. Tired and sleepy, sleepy and tired. Bye now.
[2023-03-22 13:44:40] Omi Maurin: Just had a showe!!!  Yay!
Not like Monica’s, but it’ll do. The stupid door kept opening all the time. 
Laura, my new neighbour already put Rob to work.
[2023-03-22 13:49:49] Rob Maurin: We just had a conversation with the doctor. I’ve created a document with all of my notes, as usual. And as usual, if you have any questions, or any problems with the document, just let me know.
[2023-03-22 13:49:52] Rob Maurin: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10g3kiQZ70K2JN-FMVikH-1PAk93XZgcw2iyoPnKIL4k/edit
[2023-03-22 13:59:00] Rob Maurin: We’re going to head out now. 
Not sure what our visit time is for tomorrow but we’ll think it through and report our conclusion here.
[2023-03-22 14:20:45] Mom Monica Maurin: I aim to go visit mom tomorrow afternoon, after work. ideally I would leave home at 1:15 pm, but maybe by 2pm
[2023-03-22 14:24:21] Mom Monica Maurin: Dad, don't worry about the preparation details and the paper instructions. Aidan and I will figure all of that out and tell you what we need your help on, if anything. And we will take care of it. Just ignore them for now and we will chat later about it. And we will arrive at 11 AM on Friday if that works for you, so that we have ample time before the 1 pm video call.
[2023-03-22 14:24:55] Mom Monica Maurin: And if the video call doesn't seem useful we will tell the video physio person that it's not an appropriate tool for you/this purpose and we will get something else.
[2023-03-22 15:14:05] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks for your report Robert, I agree that having Mom at home now will not make her any better.
[2023-03-22 15:18:54] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks, Monique. See you on Friday. Will write later.
[2023-03-22 15:19:53] Grandpa Maurin: Just coordinated with George and we will depart at 7 as usual.
[2023-03-22 15:37:51] Rob Maurin: Teri and I will visit mom early tomorrow! Aim to be there before 9:30
[2023-03-22 15:40:05] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok dad. Let me know when you can chat. I have just a couple of quick questions for you so that I know what to ask for on your behalf. Thanks! Have a nice visit with mom.
[2023-03-22 19:24:10] Grandpa Maurin: Good night all.

[2023-03-23 04:54:23] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
Not a good night for my neighbour Laura, poor soul. She is nice, but apparently in a lot of pain and breathing problems. 
Let’s hope tomorrow is better for her / us.
[2023-03-23 05:10:04] Mom Monica Maurin: Classic. Love it. Thank you!
[2023-03-23 05:10:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Sorry to hear it!
Did you get some sleep though? How is your pain doing?
[2023-03-23 05:22:06] Omi Maurin: Pain ok. 
A bit sleepy, but ok.
[2023-03-23 05:50:42] Teri Smith: We’re on our way to see Vally. Let us know if you’d like us pick up anything.
[2023-03-23 05:52:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Wonderful!! I just spoke with mom -- and we had to hang up because someone came to her who needed her attention. So just in case it's the physiotherapist and you don't hear back from mom, she mentioned to me that her breakfast was too yucky and she'd like you guys to take her to Tims or something yummy like that this morning -- just a heads up in case mom doesn't get back to you. xo
[2023-03-23 05:54:56] Omi Maurin: Copuchenta!! 🤣🤣
[2023-03-23 05:55:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Letting them know in case they were going to stop before they get to you....this way you can go together or else they will be so full of coffeee....slooosh sloooosh!
[2023-03-23 05:56:19] Omi Maurin: The nurse came to check BP etc
[2023-03-23 05:56:30] Mom Monica Maurin: And? Did you do well?
[2023-03-23 05:56:30] Teri Smith: Vally, would you prefer Tim’s or something else we pick up on the way?
[2023-03-23 05:58:36] Omi Maurin: Tim’s ok but not 100 % necessary.  😉
Your visit is all I need 😘
[2023-03-23 05:58:45] Mom Monica Maurin: pants on fire!
[2023-03-23 06:22:15] Grandpa Maurin: Vally do you want earplugs for tonight ?
[2023-03-23 06:22:41] Grandpa Maurin: I am going to have breakfast now.
[2023-03-23 06:23:01] Omi Maurin: 🤣🤣🤣 great idea!! 👏🏼👏🏼
[2023-03-23 06:24:25] Omi Maurin: I sort of had breakfast….  Better things to come?? 😊
[2023-03-23 06:26:30] Grandpa Maurin: It seems that yesterday was a day for my body to process the iron overload but today I feel strong. My toasts are calling me , bye.
[2023-03-23 06:26:48] Mom Monica Maurin: enjoy!
[2023-03-23 06:27:20] Omi Maurin: Have a great day. Relax!!!!! 😘🥰
[2023-03-23 06:53:31] Rob Maurin: We’re at Tim’s with mom ☕️
[2023-03-23 06:54:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Enjoy :) - mom, remember the chococlate chillers that Daniela mentioned!
[2023-03-23 06:55:35] Grandpa Maurin: Have fun at Tim’s. I finished my breakfast, put the laundry in the dryer and will look for earplugs
‎[2023-03-23 07:21:26] Mom Monica Maurin: ‎image absente
[2023-03-23 07:50:06] Grandpa Maurin: I am going to get her earplugs at the pharmacy so she can choose. Thanks
[2023-03-23 07:50:18] Mom Monica Maurin: ok :)
[2023-03-23 08:10:55] Rob Maurin: We’ve returned mom to her suite.  
Gotta head back for my rehearsal. 
We had second breakfast at Tim’s.
[2023-03-23 08:11:02] Rob Maurin: Have a good day everyone!
[2023-03-23 08:11:45] Omi Maurin: Thanks!!!  😘
[2023-03-23 08:15:24] Omi Maurin: My “neighbour “ must have several “muffin suppliers “. Again she is nibbling at one 🤣
[2023-03-23 09:23:24] Mom Monica Maurin: haha!!
[2023-03-23 10:41:00] Mom Monica Maurin: Leaving home. On my way to see mom. Mom, we will find something to eat in the cafeteria unless you phone me with another idea. Xox
[2023-03-23 11:26:22] Grandpa Maurin: I’m home and hungry!
[2023-03-23 11:39:19] Mom Monica Maurin: Just pulled into the hospital parking lot. Gonna see mom soon!
Glad you’re home and hungry dad!
[2023-03-23 11:40:54] Omi Maurin: Yayyy
[2023-03-23 12:18:15] Grandpa Maurin: Okay , Blue Jays ! Tired and sleepy, sleepy and tired.
[2023-03-23 13:06:02] Mom Monica Maurin: Zzzzzzz 👍
[2023-03-23 14:09:57] Mom Monica Maurin: Hi all. Mom just did a few laps of the ward and she did super-duper…and while we were out there Dr. Gong stopped us and said that he had spoken with the physiatrist and the physiatrist said he wants the surgeon to have a look at mom’s MRI to see if surgery is actually an option. It may or may not be. If it is not, then the physiatrist will give counsel on next steps for care/exercises etc. 
The surgeon is busy with surgeries during the day so when she/he gets a chance in the evenings (in the coming days?) she will review mom’s MRIs and let Dr Gong know about the surgical opinion.
[2023-03-23 14:14:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Dr Gong further confirmed that the tear is at the spine — specifically he said it’s the “tenderloin if mom was an animal”
[2023-03-23 14:15:51] Mom Monica Maurin: I further confirm mom is actually very human.
[2023-03-23 14:18:26] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Great!
[2023-03-23 14:35:15] Rob Maurin: I'm so happy we got the word from the physiatrist! That's great news. And not that I want mom to undergo surgery, but it's great that they're considering all options rather than taking a shortcut. Yay!
[2023-03-23 14:35:30] Rob Maurin: How are you feeling, mom?
[2023-03-23 14:36:00] Rob Maurin: Hmmm... I'm not sure about that. Maybe we should ask for another MRI
[2023-03-23 14:45:23] Omi Maurin: Ha ha ha. 🤣
[2023-03-23 14:45:49] Omi Maurin: Feeling fine, thanks!
[2023-03-23 15:30:42] Grandpa Maurin: That’s a lot of news to digest. Glad to hear that the doctor is really interested in Vally’s case.
[2023-03-23 16:46:55] Mom Monica Maurin: In my car and on my way home. Had a lovely visit with  mom. Xo
[2023-03-23 16:47:59] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks , Monique.
[2023-03-23 17:30:12] Mom Monica Maurin: I’m home! Light speed. Night night all. I hope we all have a good night.
[2023-03-23 17:31:35] Omi Maurin: Great!!!!  Good night!
[2023-03-23 17:31:39] Grandpa Maurin: Thanks. George and I are about to leave Vally.
[2023-03-23 17:44:05] Omi Maurin: Nothing wrong with Laura’s (my neighbour’s) hearing. 
When George and Dad were leaving she said to dad “nice haircut dude!”
She obviously must have heard us complimenting dad on his haircut.
[2023-03-23 17:52:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Hahaha!!!! Oh my god!
[2023-03-23 17:52:40] Aidan Maurin-Jones: Thats AMAZING!!
[2023-03-23 17:58:46] Teri Smith: Give her a pair of ear plugs! 😀
[2023-03-23 18:18:18] Grandpa Maurin: I’m home 🏡, ready to “cook “ my dinner. Good night everyone!
[2023-03-23 19:00:24] Mom Monica Maurin: 💤
[2023-03-24 03:38:40] Rob Maurin: We’re boarded and ready to push off.  Have a good weekend, everyone.  Mom, get well.  Dad, take it easy.  Monica and Aidan, thanks for holding down the fort.  Kai, go be smart.  :-)
[2023-03-24 04:01:26] Grandpa Maurin: Have a great time R&T, ❤️

[2023-03-24 04:59:12] Omi Maurin: Good morning everyone!!
Have an amazing day!!
[2023-03-24 05:08:44] Rob Maurin: Landed safely.  The adventure in rainy New York begins.  (It begins, actually, in New Jersey.  Go figure.)
[2023-03-24 05:17:25] Omi Maurin: Great!  
Enjoying your updates already!! 👍😘
[2023-03-24 06:01:49] Mom Monica Maurin: Nice :)
[2023-03-24 06:02:23] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning all - Aidan and I are getting ready to leave. We aim to be at dad’s at 10:30. 
How was everyone’s sleep? Mom, how are things?
[2023-03-24 06:02:33] Mom Monica Maurin: Let us know if you need anything.
[2023-03-24 06:13:35] Grandpa Maurin: All is well under control here!
Do not rush Monique, the video is at 1 p m
[2023-03-24 06:16:11] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok
[2023-03-24 07:12:36] Rob Maurin: We’ve dropped our bags at the hotel.  And now… I have no idea what! Breakfast, maybe?
[2023-03-24 07:14:44] Omi Maurin: Is there a special NY breakfast?
[2023-03-24 07:17:27] Grandpa Maurin: Pancakes and root 🍺!
[2023-03-24 07:20:28] Omi Maurin: I was going to suggest hot dog and root beer 🍺 at Woolworth 🤣
Our first meal in NY in 1967
[2023-03-24 08:02:37] Grandpa Maurin: Monique and Aidan arrived and brought a lot of food and stuff!
[2023-03-24 08:03:06] Grandpa Maurin: Not to mention a ton of information!!!!
[2023-03-24 08:05:37] Omi Maurin: Enjoy and have a productive day!!!
[2023-03-24 08:22:05] Rob Maurin: If there was still a Woolworth’s here I would do that in your honour!!!!
‎[2023-03-24 09:27:16] Teri Smith: ‎image absente
[2023-03-24 09:34:33] Rob Maurin: (We never did have breakfast.)
[2023-03-24 09:50:32] Mom Monica Maurin: Hey there! Dad and Aidan and I had a great chat this morning and have covered a lot of ground. Dad has been a trooper!!
We are going to join the zoom chat with the hospital physio department at 1:30 and then have lunch here. 
Mom, we will message you later about how the rest of the day is going.
[2023-03-24 09:56:40] Omi Maurin: Great! Good news!
Talked to Ulla this morning. She again offered her walker and cane, but I told her that it might be less stressful to rent something in Mississauga instead of picking it up in West Hill.
[2023-03-24 09:57:33] Omi Maurin: Dr gong just dropped in to say he is still waiting to hear from an orthopaedic surgeon.
[2023-03-24 10:00:49] Omi Maurin: The physiotherapist indicated this morning that “the team” thinks I’m ready to go home, but the doctor insists in second opinion.
[2023-03-24 10:11:09] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok. Good to know. 
Really happy to hear that the rest of the team thinks things are going so well for you. Also happy to hear that the doctor wants to ensure you get full information and options available.
[2023-03-24 10:11:48] Mom Monica Maurin: After lunch we will be going shopping for dad’s tools :)

Will keep you posted.
[2023-03-24 10:14:06] Rob Maurin: Thanks for the updates!
[2023-03-24 10:28:43] Omi Maurin: Call ahead, because according to a list they gave me, one place closes at 4pm
[2023-03-24 10:29:37] Mom Monica Maurin: Pls send any addresses to places if you have them. Thanks.
[2023-03-24 10:30:28] Omi Maurin: George knows one close by

The same building of Dt Cheah
[2023-03-24 10:40:36] Mom Monica Maurin: Ok thanks.
[2023-03-24 10:40:41] Mom Monica Maurin: On the zoom chat now.
[2023-03-24 10:40:51] Omi Maurin: 🤞🏻
[2023-03-24 11:26:28] Omi Maurin: Laura is asking if any of you are visiting, if you could please bring her a carrot muffin from Tim’s. She has money. 
Thanks
[2023-03-24 11:28:58] Rob Maurin: She’ll have to wait a week…
[2023-03-24 11:30:50] Mom Monica Maurin: Yeah. We will See. We are going to have lunch now and then go shopping for dad. Will see how timing works out. Will keep in touch 
The zoom with the hospital was excellent! Dad is at the top of his class. Not that I’m competitive though….
Xxoo
Will update more later.
[2023-03-24 11:38:47] Omi Maurin: Soo glad to hear!!
[2023-03-24 12:03:50] Mom Monica Maurin: Little change of plans…we have a bit more “homework” to do with dad and it will be too much for all of us to go shopping next. Given what we learned today, it’s perfectly fine for dad and George to start shopping tomorrow. So that the plan. 
Mom, when we leave dad’s we will let you know if we are headed your way. Still to be determined. :)
I hope you’re having a good day.
[2023-03-24 12:23:24] Mom Monica Maurin: Mom, Aidan and I are leaving dad’s soon and heading to you.
[2023-03-24 12:37:20] Grandpa Maurin: Monica and Aidan have left. I will take a nap and I’ll go to visit you as usual with  G&M.
[2023-03-24 12:38:12] Omi Maurin: Enjoy your nap!! 💤😴👍
[2023-03-24 12:39:16] Grandpa Maurin: Monica and Aidan brought a lot of information for me  , they worked extremely hard.
[2023-03-24 12:39:48] Omi Maurin: So sweet!
[2023-03-24 12:58:43] Mom Monica Maurin: Arrived at hospital. See you in a minute mom
[2023-03-24 12:59:27] Omi Maurin: Yayyy
Remember the muffin for Laura pls
[2023-03-24 16:00:47] Mom Monica Maurin: Thanks for the visit mom. 
Aidan and I are now on the car and on our way home. 
(Maybe you can call Nenen back now?) Xo
[2023-03-24 16:01:50] Grandpa Maurin: Leaving with George for th hospital at 7:15
[2023-03-24 16:28:01] Omi Maurin: Thank YOU for the visit.  Sorry I had to kick you out 😉
I did call Nenén; she sends her love.
[2023-03-24 16:34:56] Aidan Maurin-Jones: No problem. It was great seeing you! :)
[2023-03-24 17:02:27] Mom Monica Maurin: We are home now. :)
[2023-03-24 17:17:44] Omi Maurin: Great. Thanks again
[2023-03-24 17:31:40] Mom Monica Maurin: Night night. Xoxoxooxoxox
[2023-03-24 17:33:35] Grandpa Maurin: Good night to you and Aidan and many thanks for all your efforts.

[2023-03-25 04:53:53] Omi Maurin: Good morning!
How are you all doing?
I had a pretty good night with earplugs. I’m not sure if Laura had a better night as well, or if I just didn’t hear her.  I’m afraid to ask 😉
[2023-03-25 05:02:34] Mom Monica Maurin: Good morning. I am ok. Nauseating migraine for last few hours -- and luckily now it has started raining/freezing raining so I am beginning to feel better.
[2023-03-25 05:02:49] Mom Monica Maurin: You're right -- don't ask Laura how she's doing. :)
[2023-03-25 05:04:36] Mom Monica Maurin: I have watched many videos on psoas and stretches etc and I just saw one today that best shows things and even shows some ways to lengthen the muscles so that they function well and don't continue to strain the body. Mom, of course, you should not do any of these stretches and should do only what your med team say you're ready to do, but here is the video so that you can see in the first few minutes very clearly which muscles you're working to heal. Very neat.
[2023-03-25 05:04:38] Mom Monica Maurin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SVJvstoBR0
[2023-03-25 05:05:48] Omi Maurin: Ohhhh I’m so sorry.   Relax, do your stuff and DON’T come to Mississauga.
[2023-03-25 05:06:38] Omi Maurin: Thanks
[2023-03-25 05:08:22] Mom Monica Maurin: Yeah, thanks. Right now driving is not an option. I just don't feel well enough. But if it clears up, we'll see. Let me know if you want to have a chat on the phone, if it's quiet enough around you. xox
[2023-03-25 05:09:18] Omi Maurin: Right now nurses doing their rounds. Very noisy.
[2023-03-25 05:11:38] Mom Monica Maurin: okey dokey. you know where to find me :)
[2023-03-25 05:37:40] Grandpa Maurin: Monica take the day off , it is an order, do not drive today and sleep your migraine off.!!!
[2023-03-25 05:39:19] Rob Maurin: Crappy! Get well!
[2023-03-25 05:40:29] Grandpa Maurin: R&T, are you having fun in N Y?
[2023-03-25 05:47:50] Rob Maurin: Yes, thank you! So far we’ve just walked around (23,000 steps yesterday!), then met up with our friends and saw a show last night, and then had tapas after.  No idea what we’re doing next.  Teri and I have done no planning!!
[2023-03-25 05:54:19] Grandpa Maurin: Sounds great, keep on enjoying it the Big 🍎! Miss you! ❤️
[2023-03-25 06:09:48] Teri Smith: Just a wee correction - we did 27,000 steps yesterday. 😀
[2023-03-25 06:19:09] Grandpa Maurin: With those 4,000 additional steps you qualify for new sneakers that you can claim duty free!!!
[2023-03-25 06:30:34] Rob Maurin: We might need to! According to my rough calculations, it’s about 16K
[2023-03-25 06:36:35] Omi Maurin: I just had a good physio session with a male physiotherapist. 
He gave me several pointers.  He also said that the government will pick up 75% of the walker. Will see…. The regular physiotherapist didn’t say anything like that, to the contrary; she gave me a list where to buy / rent one.
[2023-03-25 06:38:06] Teri Smith: I don’t know the details, but Maureen said her mom’s walker was at least partially covered, so it’s worth looking into!
[2023-03-25 06:41:37] Omi Maurin: He said Alfonso will need the aluminum, 2 wheeler, because he will put more weight on it with the knee surgery. 
In my case it’s more for stability inside and outside.
[2023-03-25 06:49:16] Grandpa Maurin: Good you had a good therapy session . Next time ask the guy how the government 75 % assistance is claimed. I will enquire when we buy my walker, etc. today. Will meet with George at 11 a m .
[2023-03-25 07:07:30] Omi Maurin: Good luck 🤞🏻
[2023-03-25 08:21:17] Mom Monica Maurin: Good luck, Dad -- get lots of neat things.
[2023-03-25 11:15:11] Grandpa Maurin: Been to several places and bought  the Walker, the skis, a cane and a urinal . Photo follows.

[2023-03-25 12:15:11] Rob Maurin: How are you feeling, Mom?
[2023-03-25 12:19:28] Omi Maurin: Feeling fine, thanks. Watching the rain melt the snow. 👏🏼👍
[2023-03-25 12:33:02] Rob Maurin: It’s rainy here too, so we got classy and intellectual and went to the Whitney Museum.  

That’s enough of that :-)
[2023-03-25 12:42:50] Omi Maurin: Nothing but pictures??? 🤣
[2023-03-25 12:47:07] Mom Monica Maurin: Feeling much better thanks. So mom and I have been watching videos and chatting on the phone to help pass the time :)
[2023-03-25 12:47:19] Mom Monica Maurin: Have fun at the gallery!
[2023-03-25 13:03:23] Rob Maurin: Exactly!!! So many pictures
