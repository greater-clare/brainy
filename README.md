## Brainy: Virtual Screening Assistant

Receiving support for mood disorders, anxiety, ADHD, and other mental health disorders can be a daunting task. 
In BC, [where 26% of residents donâ€™t have a family doctor](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2020001/article/00004-eng.htm), access to treatment is additionally hindered by a lack of pre-existing medical records and lengthy gaps between appointments. 
Even after a first appointment with a general practitioner, BC patients face [a median wait of 33.3 weeks](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2020001/article/00004-eng.htm) before they begin receiving treatment. Given these limitations, the initial screening process - a short form, typically completed online - is a valuable tool for physicians who need to quickly identify and allocate appropriate treatments.
While never intended as a diagnostic tool or replacement for an in-person appointment, pre-existing screening tools are simply checklists. Patients cannot ask for clarification on terminology, a problem typically faced by recent immigrants; furthermore, users in immediate emotional distress do not receive any immediate validation or reassurance. 

## Mission Statement
To improve this experience for patients, we have created a virtual mental health screening assistant powered by ChatGPT. 
Our goal is to provide a conversational, encouraging platform for mental health screening when personal care is not immediately available.
