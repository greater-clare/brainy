# Brainy: Virtual Screening Assistant

Receiving support for mood disorders, anxiety, ADHD, and other mental health challenges can be a daunting task.  
In BC, [where 26% of residents donâ€™t have a family doctor](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2020001/article/00004-eng.htm), access to treatment is additionally hindered by a lack of pre-existing medical records and lengthy gaps between appointments.  
Even after a first appointment with a general practitioner, BC patients face [a median wait of 33.3 weeks](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2020001/article/00004-eng.htm) before they begin receiving treatment.
Given these limitations, the screening questionnaire - a short form, typically completed online - is a valuable tool for physicians in onboarding new patients.  
While never intended as a replacement for an in-depth evaluation or clinical appointment, screening questionnaires are often used to quickly identify areas of concern and to evaluate whether a patient meets thresholds for diagnosis or further examination.  

Our team aims to address two barriers found in the typical administering of these questionnaires.  

- Firstly, the language used in the questionnaires is often uncertain, and patients cannot ask for clarification on terminology. This especially affects language learners and those with anxiety disorders.
- Secondly, users in emotional distress cannot receive any immediate validation or reassurance and are not directed to community resources addressing their needs.

To address these problems, we have created a virtual mental health screening assistant powered by LangChain and LLMs. Our goal is to provide a conversational, encouraging platform for mental health screening when personal care is not immediately available.  

## Roadmap

- [x] Create proof of concept app for hackathon
- [x] Create custom format for storing questionnaires
- [x] Port hackathon app to LangChain
- [ ] Create working state system for automatic evaluation
- [ ] Connect proof of concept web app to the new backend
- [ ] Develop more robust classes for handling questionnaires
- [ ] Create a tool for accessing session reports and test scores
- [ ] Test scoring system accuracy with real participants
